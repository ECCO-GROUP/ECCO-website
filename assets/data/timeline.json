Scientists also learn that Uranus’s magnetic field is tilted, so that the poles of its magnetic field are closer to the equator, unlike the Earth where magnetic pole and the rotational poles are nearly aligned. Voyager 2 is the first to image Uranus’s very dark rings and to detect temperatures as low as minus 353 degrees (59 Kelvin), which makes Uranus the coldest planet in our solar system. This encounter also marks the first time NASA’s Deep Space Network, which enables Earth to communicate with spacecraft beyond the moon, arrays antennas together to improve our ability to capture the weak radio signals from very distant spacecraft."
