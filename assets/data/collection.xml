Here, we use novel observations of bathymetry and water temperature from NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland mission to quantify the role of warm, salty Atlantic Water in controlling the evolution of 37 glaciers. Modeled ocean-induced undercutting of calving margins compared with ice advection and ice-front retreat observed by satellites from 1985 to 2015 indicate that 35 glaciers retreated when cumulative anomalies in ocean-induced undercutting rose above the range of seasonal variability of calving-front positions, while 2 glaciers standing on shallow sills and colder water did not retreat. Deviations in the observed timing of retreat are explained by residual uncertainties in bathymetry, inefficient mixing of waters in shallow fjords, and the presence of small floating sections. Overall, warmer ocean temperature triggered the retreat, but calving processes dominate ablation (71%).</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Dynamically Consistent, Multivariable Ocean Climatology</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>2107-2128</pages><volume>99</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/BAMS-D-17-0213.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., P.

The estimate was produced from a least squares fit of a free-running ocean general circulation model to almost all available near-global data. Data coverage in space and time during this period is far more homogeneous than in any earlier interval and includes CTD, elephant seal, and Argo temperature and salinity profiles; sea ice coverage; full altimetric and gravity-field coverage; satellite sea surface temperatures; and the initializing meteorological coverage from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim). Dominant remaining data inhomogeneity arises from increasing coverage from the Argo profiles from about 2000 to the present. The state estimate exactly satisfies the primitive equations of the free-running Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm) at all times and hence produces values satisfying the fundamental conservation laws of energy, freshwater, and so forth, permitting its use for climate change studies. Quantities such as calculated heat content depend upon all observations, not just temperature, for example, altimetric height and meteorological exchanges. Output files are publicly available in Network Common Data Form (netCDF) and MATLAB form and include hydrographic variables, three components of velocity, and pressure at all depths, as well as other variables, including inferred air?sea momentum and buoyancy fluxes, 3D mixing parameters, and sea ice cover.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Triest, Ludwig</author><author>Sierens, Tim</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Van der Stocken, Tom</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inferring Connectivity Range in Submerged Aquatic Populations (Ruppia L.)

Established long-term and large-scale patterns of connectivity in lagoon systems can be strongly determined by patterns of coastal surface water currents next to local bird-mediated seed dispersal. Despite the importance of dispersal in landscape ecology, characterizing patterns of connectivity remains challenging in aquatic systems. Here, we aimed at inferring connectivity distances of Ruppia cirrhosa along European coastal lagoons using a population genetic imprint and modelled dispersal trajectories of high-resolution ocean surface current data. We investigated 1303 individuals of 46 populations alongside subbasins of the Mediterranean (Balearic, Tyrrhenian, Ionian) and the Atlantic to Baltic Sea coastline over maximum distances of 563-2684 km. Ten microsatellite loci under an autotetraploid condition revealed a mixed sexual and vegetative reproduction mode. A pairwise FST permutation test of populations revealed high levels of historical connectivity only for distance classes up to 104-280 km. Since full range analysis was not fully explanatory, we assessed connectivity in more detail at coastline and subbasin level using four approaches. Firstly, a regression over restricted geographical distances (300 km) was done though remained comparable to full range analysis. Secondly, piecewise linear regression analyses yielded much better explained variance but the obtained breakpoints were shifted towards greater geographical distances due to a flat slope of regression lines that most likely reflect genetic drift. Thirdly, classification and regression tree analyses revealed threshold values of 47-179 km. Finally, simulated ocean surface dispersal trajectories for propagules with floating periods of 1 to 4 weeks, were congruent with inferred distances, a spatial Bayesian admixed gene pool clustering and a barrier detection method. A kinship based spatial autocorrelation showed a contemporary within-lagoon connectivity up to 20 km. Our findings indicate that strong differentiation or admixtures shaped historical connectivity and that a pre- and post LGM genetic imprint of R. cirrhosa along the European coasts was maintained from their occurrence in primary habitats. Additionally, this study demonstrates the importance of unraveling thresholds of genetic breaks in combination with ocean dispersal modelling to infer patterns of connectivity.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Ying</author><author>Feng, Ming</author><author>Du, Yan</author><author>Phillips, Helen E.</author><author>Bindoff, Nathaniel L.</author><author>McPhaden, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Strengthened Indonesian Throughflow Drives Decadal Warming in the Southern Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>6167-6175</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Ekman transport</keyword><keyword>Indonesian Throughflow</keyword><keyword>air-sea flux</keyword><keyword>heat budget</keyword><keyword>ocean boundary current</keyword><keyword>upper ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018GL078265</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhang, Y., Feng, M., Du, Y., Phillips, H.

The annual mean temperature averaged in the upper‐700 m Southern Indian Ocean during 1998–2015 has experienced significant warming at a rate of 1.03 × 10−2 °C/year. A heat budget analysis indicates that the increase is mostly driven by decreased cooling from net air‐sea heat flux and increased warming from heat advection. Increased Indonesian Throughflow advection is the largest contributor to warming the upper 700 m of the Southern Indian Ocean, while the reduction of surface turbulent heat flux is of secondary importance. These results expand our understanding of the decadal heat balance in the Indian Ocean and of Indo‐Pacific decadal climate variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jordan, James R</author><author>Holland, Paul R</author><author>Goldberg, Dan</author><author>Snow, Kate</author><author>Arthern, Robert</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Jenkins, Adrian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean-Forced Ice-Shelf Thinning in a Synchronously Coupled Ice-Ocean Model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>2219-2293</pages><volume>125</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC013251</electronic-resource-num><notes>Jordan, J.

Unlike previous, asynchronous, approaches to coupled modeling our approach is fully conservative of heat, salt, and mass. Synchronous coupling is achieved by continuously updating the ice-shelf thickness on the ocean time step. By simulating an idealized, warm-water ice shelf we show how raising the pycnocline leads to a reduction in both ice-shelf mass and back stress, and hence buttressing. Coupled runs show the formation of a western boundary channel in the ice-shelf base due to increased melting on the western boundary due to Coriolis enhanced flow. Eastern boundary ice thickening is also observed. This is not the case when using a simple depth-dependent parameterized melt, as the ice shelf has relatively thinner sides and a thicker central ‘‘bulge’’ for a given ice-shelf mass. Ice-shelf geometry arising from the parameterized melt rate tends to underestimate backstress (and therefore buttressing) for a given ice-shelf mass due to a thinner ice shelf at the boundaries when compared to coupled model simulations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khatiwala, Samar</author><author>Graven, Heather</author><author>Payne, Sarah</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes to the Air-Sea Flux and Distribution of Radiocarbon in the Ocean Over the 21st Century</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>5617-5626</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018GL078172</electronic-resource-num><notes>Khatiwala, S., H.

Strong decreases in atmospheric Δ14C in the high-emission scenario result in strong outgassing of 14C over 2050–2100, causing Δ14C spatial gradients in the surface ocean and vertical gradients between the surface and intermediate waters to reverse sign. Surface Δ14C in the subtropical gyres is lower than Δ14C in Pacific Deep Water and Southern Ocean surface water in 2100. In the low-emission scenario, ocean Δ14C remains slightly higher than in 1950 and relatively constant over 2050–2100. Over the next 20 years we find decadal changes in Δ14C of −30‰ to +5‰ in the upper 2 km of the ocean, which should be detectable with continued hydrographic surveys. Our simulations can help in planning future observations, and they provide a baseline for investigating natural or anthropogenic changes in ocean circulation using ocean Δ14C observations and models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sonnewald, Maike</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linear Predictability: A Sea Surface Height Case Study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>2599-2611</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0142.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sonnewald, M., C.

Twenty years of the Estimating the Circulation and Cli- mate of the Ocean (ECCOv4) state estimate (1992–2011) are used, fitting autoregressive moving average [ARMA(n, m)] models where the order of the coefficients is chosen by the Akaike information criteria (AIC). Up to 50% of the ocean SSH variability is dominated by the seasonal signal. The variance accounted for by the nonseasonal SSH is particularly distinct in the Southern and Pacific Oceans, containing .95% of the total SSH variance, and the expected prediction error growth takes a few months to reach a threshold of 1 cm. Isolated regions take 12 months or more to cross an accuracy threshold of 1 cm. Including the trend significantly increases the time taken to reach the threshold, particularly in the South Pacific. Annual averaging has expected pre- diction error growth of a few years to reach a threshold of 1 cm. Including the trend mainly increases the time taken to reach the threshold, but the time series is short and noisy.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards determining uncertainties in global oceanic mean values of heat, salt, and surface elevation</title><secondary-title>Tellus A: Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tellus A: Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/16000870.2018.1471911</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2018: Towards determining uncertainties in global oceanic mean values of heat, salt, and surface elevation.

The essential step of separating stochastic from systematic or deterministic elements of the fields is explored by suppressing the globally correlated components of the fields. Justification lies in the physics and the brevity of a 20-year estimate relative to the full oceanic adjustment time, and the inferred near-linearity of response on short time intervals. Lower-bound uncertainties reflecting the only stochastic elements of the state estimate are then calculated from bootstrap estimates. Trends are estimated as 2:2 6 0:2 mm=y in elevation, 0.0011 ± 0.0001 C/y, and ( 2.825 ± 0.17) 10 5 for surface elevation, temperature and salt, with formal 2-standard deviation uncertainties. The temperature change corresponds to a 20-year average ocean heating rate of 0:4860:1 W/m2 of which 0.1 W/m2 arises from the geothermal forcing.

A previously-developed scheme to allow continuous vertical movement of the ice-ocean interface of a floating ice shelf (“vertical coupling”) is built upon to allow continuous movement of the grounding line, or point of floa- tation of the ice sheet (“horizontal coupling”). Horizontal coupling is implemented through the maintenance of a thin layer of ocean ( ∼ 1 m) under grounded ice, which is inflated into the real ocean as the ice ungrounds. This is accomplished through a modification of the ocean model’s nonlinear free surface evolution in a manner akin to a hydrological model in the presence of steep bathymetry. The coupled model is applied to a number of idealized geometries and shown to successfully represent ocean-forced marine ice sheet retreat while maintaining a continuous ocean circulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferreira, David</author><author>Cessi, Paola</author><author>Coxall, Helen K</author><author>de Boer, Agatha</author><author>Dijkstra, Henk A</author><author>Drijfhout, Sybren S</author><author>Eldevik, Tor</author><author>Harnik, Nili</author><author>McManus, Jerry F</author><author>Marshall, David P</author><author>Nilsson, Johan</author><author>Roquet, Fabien</author><author>Schneider, Tapio</author><author>Wills, Robert C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atlantic-Pacific Asymmetry in Deep Water Formation</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>327-352</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-earth-082517-010045</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ferreira, D., and Coauthors, 2018: Atlantic-Pacific Asymmetry in Deep Water Formation.

This asymmetric global overturning pattern has persisted for the past 2–3 million years, with evidence for different ventilation modes in the deeper past. In the current climate, the Atlantic-Pacific asymmetry occurs because the Atlantic is more saline, enabling deep convection. To what extent the salinity contrast between the two basins is dominated by atmospheric processes (larger net evaporation over the Atlantic) or oceanic processes (salinity transport into the Atlantic) remains an outstanding question. Numerical simulations have provided support for both mechanisms; observations of the present climate support a strong role for atmospheric processes as well as some modulation by oceanic processes. A major avenue for future work is the quantification of the various processes at play to identify which mechanisms are primary in different climate states.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Landerer, Felix W</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tide gauge records reveal improved processing of gravity recovery and climate experiment time-variable mass solutions over the coastal ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><pages>1401-1412</pages><volume>214</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><notes>Piecuch, C.

Synthetic observations sampled from an ocean general circulation model exhibit similar patterns of correspondence between modelled TG and MC time-series and differences between MC and SH time-series in terms of their relationship with TG time-series, suggesting that observational results here are generally consistent with expectations from ocean dynamics. This work demonstrates the improved quality of recent MC solutions compared to earlier SH estimates over the coastal ocean, and suggests that the MC solutions could be a useful tool for understanding contemporary coastal sea level variability and change.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, R.

The largest spatial gradients in ζ trends, predicted from solving the sea level equation using GRACE retrievals of mass distribution over land for the period 2005–15, occur near Greenland and West Antarctica, consistent with a strong local land ice loss. Misinterpreting the estimated static GAL trends in ζ as dynamic pressure gradients can lead to substantial errors in large-scale geostrophic transports across the Southern Ocean and the subpolar North Atlantic over the analyzed decade. South of Greenland, where altimeter sea level and hydrography (Argo) data coverage is good, the residual ζ minus steric height trends are similar in magnitude and sign to the gravitationally based predictions. In addition, estimated GAL-related trends are as large—if not larger than—other factors, such as deep steric height, dynamic bottom pressure, and glacial isostatic rebound. Thus, accounting for static GAL effects on ζ records, which are commonly neglected in oceanographic studies, seems important for a quantitative interpretation of the observed ζ trends.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stewart, Andrew L.</author><author>Klocker, Andreas</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circum-Antarctic Shoreward Heat Transport Derived From an Eddy- and Tide-Resolving Simulation</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>834-845</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Antarctic margins</keyword><keyword>eddies</keyword><keyword>heat flux</keyword><keyword>modeling</keyword><keyword>overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017GL075677</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stewart, A.

This study quantifies the roles of mean and transient flows in transporting heat across almost the entire Antarctic continental slope and shelf using an ocean/sea ice model run at eddy- and tide-resolving (1/48°) horizontal resolution. Heat transfer by transient flows is approximately attributed to eddies and tides via a decomposition into time scales shorter than and longer than 1 day, respectively. It is shown that eddies transfer heat across the continental slope (ocean depths greater than 1,500 m), but tides produce a stronger shoreward heat flux across the shelf break (ocean depths between 500 m and 1,000 m). However, the tidal heat fluxes are approximately compensated by mean flows, leaving the eddy heat flux to balance the net shoreward heat transport. The eddy-driven cross-slope overturning circulation is too weak to account for the eddy heat flux. This suggests that isopycnal eddy stirring is the principal mechanism of shoreward heat transport around Antarctica, though likely modulated by tides and surface forcing.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nils, Hutter</author><author>Martin, Losch</author><author>Dimitris, Menemenlis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scaling Properties of Arctic Sea Ice Deformation in a High-Resolution Viscous-Plastic Sea Ice Model and in Satellite Observations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>672-687</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>high-resolution modeling</keyword><keyword>scaling</keyword><keyword>sea ice deformation</keyword><keyword>sea ice rheology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC013119</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nils, H., L.

In a 1 km pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean simulation, the small-scale sea ice deformations are evaluated with a scaling analysis in relation to satellite observations of the Envisat Geophysical Processor System (EGPS) in the Central Arctic. A new coupled scaling analysis for data on Eulerian grids is used to determine the spatial and temporal scaling and the coupling between temporal and spatial scales. The spatial scaling of the modeled sea ice deformation implies multifractality. It is also coupled to temporal scales and varies realistically by region and season. The agreement of the spatial scaling with satellite observations challenges previous results with VP models at coarser resolution, which did not reproduce the observed scaling. The temporal scaling analysis shows that the VP model, as configured in this 1 km simulation, does not fully resolve the intermittency of sea ice deformation that is observed in satellite data.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, Daniel C.</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Sinha, Bablu</author><author>Josey, Simon A.</author><author>Boland, Emma J.

Using an observationally constrained ocean adjoint model, we find that annual?mean Labrador Sea heat content is sensitive to temperature/salinity changes (1) along potential source water pathways (e.g., the subpolar gyre, the North Atlantic Current, the Gulf Stream) and (2) along the West African and European shelves, which are not significant source water regions for the Labrador Sea. The West African coastal/shelf adjustment mechanism, which may be excited by changes in along?shelf wind stress, involves pressure anomalies that propagate along a coastal waveguide toward Greenland, changing the across?shelf pressure gradient in the North Atlantic and altering heat convergence in the Labrador Sea. We also find that nonlocal (in space and time) heat fluxes (e.g., in the Irminger Sea, the seas south of Iceland) can have a strong impact on Labrador Sea heat content. Understanding and predicting the state of the Labrador Sea and its potential impacts on North Atlantic climate and global surface warming will require monitoring of oceanic and atmospheric properties at remote sites in the Irminger Sea, the subpolar gyre, and along the West African and European shelf/coast system, among others.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ngeve, Magdalene N</author><author>der Stocken, Tom</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Koedam, Nico</author><author>Triest, Ludwig</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hidden founders?

Mangrove trees rely on ocean surface currents to spread their hydrochorous propagules through space. Since pollen dispersal is generally restricted to local scales, high level of short-distance propagule dispersal is expected to result in FSGS in Rhizophora spp. We investigated FSGS, recent bottleneck events, as well as historical and contemporary expansion patterns in Rhizophora racemosa populations from the entire coast of Cameroon, using 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Populations of the Cameroon Estuary complex (CEC) showed significant FSGS and significant reduction in effective population sizes (recent bottlenecks), compared to the other areas. Additionally, our results indicate stark differences between historical and contemporary expansion models. These suggest that contemporary processes such as restricted propagule dispersal, bottleneck events from high indirect and direct anthropogenic pressure, and recolonization by founders from ancient local pockets/refugia most plausibly shape the patterns of FSGS in the CEC.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van der Stocken, Tom</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling mangrove propagule dispersal trajectories using high-resolution estimates of ocean surface winds and currents</title><secondary-title>Biotropica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biotropica</full-title></periodical><pages>472-481</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Mozambique Channel</keyword><keyword>Western Indian Ocean</keyword><keyword>connectivity</keyword><keyword>eddy currents</keyword><keyword>long distance dispersal</keyword><keyword>tidal motion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/btp.12440</electronic-resource-num><notes>Van der Stocken, T., and D.

Quantitating connectivity of mangrove patches is an important conservation concern. Current estimates of connectivity, however, fail to integrate the link between ocean currents at different spatial scales and dispersal trajectories. Here, we use high-resolution estimates of ocean currents and surface winds from meteorological and oceanographic analyses, in conjunction with experimental data on propagule traits (e.g., density, size, and shape) and dispersal vector properties (e.g., strength and direction of water and wind currents). We incorporate these data in a dispersal model to illustrate the potential effect of wind on dispersal trajectories of hydrochorous propagules from different mangrove species. We focus on the Western Indian Ocean, including the Mozambique Channel, which has received much attention because of its reported oceanic complexity, to illustrate the effect of oceanic features such as eddy currents and tides. In spite of the complex pattern of ocean surface currents and winds, some propagules are able to cross the Mozambique Channel. Eddy currents and tides may delay arrival at a suitable site. Experimentally demonstrated differences in wind sensitivity among propagule types were shown to affect the probability of departure and the shape of dispersal trajectories. The model could be used to reconstruct current fluxes of mangrove propagules that may help explain past and current distributions of mangrove forests and assess the potential for natural expansion of these forests.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, Nat</author><author>Straneo, Fiammetta</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Satellite-derived submarine melt rates and mass balance (2011–2015) for Greenland’s largest remaining ice tongues</title><secondary-title>The Cryosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cryosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>2773-2782</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/tc-11-2773-2017</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wilson, N., F.

While submarine melting is recog- nized as a major contributor to mass loss, the spatial distri- bution of submarine melting and its contribution to the to- tal mass balance of these floating extensions is incompletely known and understood. Here, we use high-resolution World- View satellite imagery collected between 2011 and 2015 to infer the magnitude and spatial variability of melt rates un- der Greenland’s largest remaining ice tongues – Nioghalvf- jerdsbræ (79 North Glacier, 79N), Ryder Glacier (RG), and Petermann Glacier (PG). Submarine melt rates under the ice tongues vary considerably, exceeding 50ma−1 near the grounding zone and decaying rapidly downstream. Channels, likely originating from upstream subglacial channels, give rise to large melt variations across the ice tongues. We com- pare the total melt rates to the influx of ice to the ice tongue to assess their contribution to the current mass balance. At Petermann Glacier and Ryder Glacier, we find that the com- bined submarine and aerial melt approximately balances the ice flux from the grounded ice sheet. At Nioghalvfjerdsbræ the total melt flux (14.2 ± 0.96 km3 a−1 w.e., water equiva- lent) exceeds the inflow of ice (10.2 ± 0.59 km3 a−1 w.e.), in- dicating present thinning of the ice tongue.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clayton, Sophie</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Jahn, Oliver</author><author>Hill, Christopher</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Follows, Michael J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biogeochemical versus ecological consequences of modeled ocean physics</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2877-2889</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-14-2877-2017</electronic-resource-num><notes>Clayton, S., S.

Surprisingly, we find that the modeled phy- toplankton community is largely unchanged, with the same phenotypes dominating in both cases. Conversely, there are large regional and seasonal variations in primary production, phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. In the subtropics, mixed layer depths (MLDs) are, on average, deeper in the eddy-permitting model, resulting in higher nutrient supply driving increases in primary production and phytoplankton biomass. In the higher latitudes, differences in winter mixed layer depths, the timing of the onset of the spring bloom and vertical nutrient supply result in lower primary produc- tion in the eddy-permitting model. Counterintuitively, this does not drive a decrease in phytoplankton biomass but re- sults in lower zooplankton biomass. We explain these sim- ilarities and differences in the model using the framework of resource competition theory, and find that they are the consequence of changes in the regional and seasonal nutri- ent supply and light environment, mediated by differences in the modeled mixed layer depths. Although previous work has suggested that complex models may respond chaotically and unpredictably to changes in forcing, we find that our model responds in a predictable way to different ocean circulation forcing, despite its complexity. The use of frameworks, such as resource competition theory, provides a tractable way to explore the differences and similarities that occur. As this model has many similarities to other widely used biogeo- chemical models that also resolve multiple phytoplankton phenotypes, this study provides important insights into how the results of running these models under different physical conditions might be more easily understood.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, An</author><author>Ocaña, Victor</author><author>Garg, Vikram</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Toole, John</author><author>Krishfield, Richard</author><author>Lee, Craig</author><author>Rainville, Luc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Benefit of Current and Future ALPS Data for Improving Arctic Coupled Ocean-Sea Ice State Estimation</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>69-73</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2017.223</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nguyen, A., V.

The synergy between ALPS-based observations and coupled ocean-sea ice state and parameter estimation as practiced in the Arctic Subpolar gyre sTate Estimate (ASTE) project is illustrated through several examples. In the western Arctic, Ice- Tethered Pro lers have been providing important hydrographic constraints of the water column down to 800 m depth since 2004. ASTE takes advantage of these detailed constraints to infer vertical pro les of diapycnal mixing rates in the central Canada Basin. The state estimation framework is also used to explore the potential utility of Argo-type oats in regions with sparse data coverage, such as the eastern Arctic and the seasonal ice zones. Finally, the framework is applied to identify potential deployment sites that optimize the impact of oat measurements on bulk oceanographic quantities of interest.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, James</author><author>Vinogradova, Nadya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Causes of accelerating sea level on the East Coast of North America</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>44</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017GL072845</electronic-resource-num><notes>Davis, J., and N.

The estimated post-1990 accelerations range from near zero to ∼0.3 mm yr-2. We find that the observed sea level acceleration is well modeled using several processes: mass change in Greenland and Antarctica as measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites; ocean dynamic and steric variability provided by the GECCO2 ocean synthesis; and the inverted barometer effect. However, to achieve this fit requires estimation of an admittance for the dynamical and steric contribution, possibly due to the coarse resolution of this analysis or to simplifications associated with parameterization of bottom friction in the shallow coastal areas. The acceleration from ice loss alone is equivalent to a regional sea level rise in one century of 0.2 m in the north and 0.75 m in the south of this region.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clayton, Sophie</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Jahn, Oliver</author><author>Hill, Christopher</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biogeochemical versus ecological consequences of modeled ocean physics</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2877-2889</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-14-2877-2017</electronic-resource-num><notes>Clayton, S., S.

We present a systematic study of the differences generated by coupling the same ecological–biogeochemical model to a 1°, coarse-resolution, and 1∕6°, eddy-permitting, global ocean circulation model to (a) biogeochemistry (e.g., primary production) and (b) phytoplankton community structure. Surprisingly, we find that the modeled phytoplankton community is largely unchanged, with the same phenotypes dominating in both cases. Conversely, there are large regional and seasonal variations in primary production, phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. In the subtropics, mixed layer depths (MLDs) are, on average, deeper in the eddy-permitting model, resulting in higher nutrient supply driving increases in primary production and phytoplankton biomass. In the higher latitudes, differences in winter mixed layer depths, the timing of the onset of the spring bloom and vertical nutrient supply result in lower primary production in the eddy-permitting model. Counterintuitively, this does not drive a decrease in phytoplankton biomass but results in lower zooplankton biomass. We explain these similarities and differences in the model using the framework of resource competition theory, and find that they are the consequence of changes in the regional and seasonal nutrient supply and light environment, mediated by differences in the modeled mixed layer depths. Although previous work has suggested that complex models may respond chaotically and unpredictably to changes in forcing, we find that our model responds in a predictable way to different ocean circulation forcing, despite its complexity. The use of frameworks, such as resource competition theory, provides a tractable way to explore the differences and similarities that occur. As this model has many similarities to other widely used biogeochemical models that also resolve multiple phytoplankton phenotypes, this study provides important insights into how the results of running these models under different physical conditions might be more easily understood.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, Nadya T</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In Search of Fingerprints of the Recent Intensification of the Ocean Water Cycle</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>5513-5528</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0626.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vinogradova, N.

Here changes in the ocean water cycle in the past two decades are examined to evaluate whether the rain-gauge notion can be extended to shorter time scales. Using a novel framework it is demonstrated that there have been persistent changes (defined as significant trends) in both salinity and the ocean water cycle in many ocean regions, including the subtropical gyres in both hemispheres, low latitudes of the tropical Pacific, the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre, and the Arctic Ocean. On average, the ocean water cycle has amplified by approximately 5% since 1993, but strong regional variations exist (as well as dependency on the surface freshwater flux products chosen). Despite an intensified ocean water cycle in the last two decades, changes in surface salinity do not follow expected patterns of amplified salinity contrasts, challenging the perception that if it rains more the seas always get fresher and if it evaporates more the seas always get saltier. These findings imply a time of emergence of anthropogenic hydrological signals shorter in surface freshwater fluxes than in surface salinity and point to the importance of ocean circulation, salt transports, and natural climate variability in shaping patterns of decadal change in surface salinity. Therefore, the use of salinity measurements in conjunction with ocean salt fluxes can provide a more meaningful way of fingerprinting changes in the global water cycle on decadal time scales. </abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bowman, K.

In order to understand its impact on carbon cycle variability, we derive the 2011?2010 annual carbon flux change (δF?) globally and specifically to Brazil using the NASA Carbon Monitoring System Flux (CMS-Flux) framework. Satellite observations of CO2, CO, and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) are ingested into a 4D-variational assimilation system driven by carbon cycle models to infer spatially resolved carbon fluxes including net ecosystem production, biomass burning, and gross primary productivity (GPP). The global 2011?2010 net carbon flux change was estimated to be δF?=?1.60 PgC, while the Brazilian carbon flux change was ?0.24 ± 0.11 PgC. This estimate is broadly within the uncertainty of previous aircraft-based estimates restricted to the Amazon basin. The 2011?2010 biomass burning change in Brazil was ?0.24 ± 0.036 PgC, which implies a near-zero 2011?2010 change of the net ecosystem production (NEP): The near-zero NEP change is the result of quantitatively comparable increases GPP (0.31 ± 0.20 PgC) and respiration in 2011. Comparisons between Brazilian and global component carbon flux changes reveal complex interactions between the processes controlling annual land-atmosphere CO2 exchanges. These results show the potential of multiple satellite observations to help quantify and spatially resolve the response of productivity and respiration fluxes to climate variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chevallier, Matthieu</author><author>Smith, Gregory C</author><author>Dupont, Frédéric</author><author>Lemieux, Jean-François</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Hernandez, Fabrice</author><author>Msadek, Rym</author><author>Peterson, K Andrew</author><author>Storto, Andrea</author><author>Toyoda, Takahiro</author><author>Valdivieso, Maria</author><author>Vernieres, Guillaume</author><author>Zuo, Hao</author><author>Balmaseda, Magdalena</author><author>Chang, You-Soon</author><author>Ferry, Nicolas</author><author>Garric, Gilles</author><author>Haines, Keith</author><author>Keeley, Sarah</author><author>Kovach, Robin M</author><author>Kuragano, Tsurane</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Tang, Yongming</author><author>Tsujino, Hiroyuki</author><author>Wang, Xiaochun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intercomparison of the Arctic sea ice cover in global ocean–sea ice reanalyses from the ORA-IP project</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>1107-1136</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-016-2985-y</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chevallier, M., et al.

This is especially true for sea ice volume, as long-term and large scale sea ice thickness observations are inexistent. Results from the Ocean ReAnalyses Intercomparison Project (ORA-IP) are presented, with a focus on Arctic sea ice fields reconstructed by state-of-the-art global ocean reanalyses. Differences between the various reanalyses are explored in terms of the effects of data assimilation, model physics and atmospheric forcing on properties of the sea ice cover, including concentration, thickness, velocity and snow. Amongst the 14 reanalyses studied here, 9 assimilate sea ice concentration, and none assimilate sea ice thickness data. The comparison reveals an overall agreement in the reconstructed concentration fields, mainly because of the constraints in surface temperature imposed by direct assimilation of ocean observations, prescribed or assimilated atmospheric forcing and assimilation of sea ice concentration. However, some spread still exists amongst the reanalyses, due to a variety of factors. In particular, a large spread in sea ice thickness is found within the ensemble of reanalyses, partially caused by the biases inherited from their sea ice model components. Biases are also affected by the assimilation of sea ice concentration and the treatment of sea ice thickness in the data assimilation process. An important outcome of this study is that the spatial distribution of ice volume varies widely between products, with no reanalysis standing out as clearly superior as compared to altimetry estimates. The ice thickness from systems without assimilation of sea ice concentration is not worse than that from systems constrained with sea ice observations. An evaluation of the sea ice velocity fields reveals that ice drifts too fast in most systems. As an ensemble, the ORA-IP reanalyses capture trends in Arctic sea ice area and extent relatively well. However, the ensemble can not be used to get a robust estimate of recent trends in the Arctic sea ice volume. Biases in the reanalyses certainly impact the simulated air–sea fluxes in the polar regions, and questions the suitability of current sea ice reanalyses to initialize seasonal forecasts.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karspeck, A R</author><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Köhl, A</author><author>Danabasoglu, G</author><author>Balmaseda, M</author><author>Smith, D M</author><author>Fujii, Y</author><author>Zhang, S</author><author>Giese, B</author><author>Tsujino, H</author><author>Rosati, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation between 1960 and 2007 in six ocean reanalysis products</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>957-982</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-015-2787-7</electronic-resource-num><notes>Karspeck, A.

Particular focus is on multi-decadal trends and interannual variability at 26.5°N and 45°N. For four of the six reanalysis products, corresponding reference simulations obtained from the same models and forcing datasets but without the imposition of subsurface data constraints are included for comparison. An emphasis is placed on identifying general characteristics of the reanalysis representation of AMOC relative to their reference simulations without subsurface data constraints. The AMOC as simulated in these two sets are presented in the context of results from the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments phase II (CORE-II) effort, wherein a common interannually varying atmospheric forcing data set was used to force a large and diverse set of global ocean-ice models. Relative to the reference simulations and CORE-II forced model simulations it is shown that (1) the reanalysis products tend to have greater AMOC mean strength and enhanced variance and (2) the reanalysis products are less consistent in their year-to-year AMOC changes. We also find that relative to the reference simulations (but not the CORE-II forced model simulations) the reanalysis products tend to have enhanced multi-decadal trends (from 1975–1995 to 1995–2007) in the mid to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scharffenberg, Martin G</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Testing the Quality of Sea-Level Data Using the GECCO Adjoint Assimilation Approach</title><secondary-title>Surveys in Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surveys in Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>349-383</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10712-016-9401-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Scharffenberg, M.

Based on decreased GECCO2 model–data residuals, upon using the altimeter data through the ESA climate change initiative (cci) sea-level (SL) project, we show here that the recently reprocessed ESA SL_cci altimeter data set (SL1) has been improved relative to the earlier AVISO altimetry data set and is now more consistent with the GECCO2 estimate and with the information about the changing ocean state embedded in other ocean data sets. The improvement can be shown to exist separately for both TOPEX/POSEIDON and ERS data sets. The study reveals that especially in regions characterized by small sea surface height (SSH) variability and small signal-to-noise ratio in the SSH data, improvements can be on the order of 30% of previously existing model–data residuals. However, in some regions we can find degradations, particulary in those where GECCO2 has little skill in representing the altimeter data and where evaluation of the products with GECCO2 is thus not advisable. Upon the assimilation of the new SL1 data set, the GECCO2 synthesis was further improved. However, adding the sea surface temperature (SST) from the SST_cci project as additional constrain, no further impact can be identified.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyssignac, B</author><author>Piecuch, C G</author><author>Merchant, C J</author><author>Racault, M.-F.</author><author>Palanisamy, H</author><author>MacIntosh, C</author><author>Sathyendranath, S</author><author>Brewin, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Causes of the Regional Variability in Observed Sea Level, Sea Surface Temperature and Ocean Colour Over the Period 1993–2011</title><secondary-title>Surveys in Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surveys in Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>187-215</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10712-016-9383-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Meyssignac, B., C.

The analysis focuses on the signature of the ocean large-scale climate fluctuations driven by the atmospheric forcing and do not address the mesoscale variability. We use the ECCO version 4 ocean reanalysis to unravel the role of ocean transport and surface buoyancy fluxes in the observed SSH, SST and OC variability. We show that the SSH regional variability is dominated by the steric effect (except at high latitude) and is mainly shaped by ocean heat transport divergences with some contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing that can be significant regionally (confirming earlier results). This is in contrast with the SST regional variability, which is the result of the compensation of surface heat fluxes by ocean heat transport in the mixed layer and arises from small departures around this background balance. Bringing together the results of SSH and SST analyses, we show that SSH and SST bear some common variability. This is because both SSH and SST variability show significant contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing. It is evidenced by the high correlation between SST and buoyancy-forced SSH almost everywhere in the ocean except at high latitude. OC, which is determined by phytoplankton biomass, is governed by the availability of light and nutrients that essentially depend on climate fluctuations. For this reason, OC shows significant correlation with SST and SSH. We show that the correlation with SST displays the same pattern as the correlation with SSH with a negative correlation in the tropics and subtropics and a positive correlation at high latitude. We discuss the reasons for this pattern.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melzer, B A</author><author>Subrahmanyam, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of GRACE Mascon Gravity Solution in Relation to Interannual Oceanic Water Mass Variations</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>907-914</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>AD 2003 to 2014</keyword><keyword>Altimetry</keyword><keyword>Argo floats data</keyword><keyword>GECCO2</keyword><keyword>GRACE mascon gravity solution</keyword><keyword>GRACE satellite mascon data set</keyword><keyword>Gravity</keyword><keyword>Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment</keyword><keyword>Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)</keyword><keyword>Harmonic analysis</keyword><keyword>Market research</keyword><keyword>Salinity (geophysical)</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword><keyword>Sea level</keyword><keyword>accelerated water cycle</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>gravity anomaly</keyword><keyword>height measurement</keyword><keyword>interannual oceanic water mass variation</keyword><keyword>mascon cell</keyword><keyword>multimission altimetry</keyword><keyword>ocean mass</keyword><keyword>oceanic freshwater budget study</keyword><keyword>precipitation pattern</keyword><keyword>remote sensing</keyword><keyword>salinity (geophysical)</keyword><keyword>salinity measurements</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword><keyword>sea surface height</keyword><keyword>spatial interannual evaporation variability</keyword><keyword>steric sea level</keyword><keyword>water cycle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TGRS.2016.2616760</electronic-resource-num><notes>Melzer, B.

Comparison of GRACE with both GECCO2 + altimetry and Argo + altimetry mass estimates revealed an offset in phase with regard to the annual cycle, but yielded an rmse of only 5.6 mm in the interannual signal after phase correction. This paper furthers evidence of an accelerated water cycle at a rate of 1.5% &amp;#x00B1; 1.1% at low latitudes, and provides a means of validation for oceanic freshwater budget studies based on salinity measurements.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>San Liang, X</author><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Chen, Shuiming</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Decadal Variability of the Eddy Kinetic Energy in the Kuroshio Extension</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1169-1187</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-16-0201.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Yang, Y., X.

Using a time-varying energetics diagnostic methodology, namely, the localized multiscale energy and vorticity analysis (MS-EVA), and the MS-EVA-based nonlinear instability theory, this study investigates the physical mechanism responsible for such variations with the state estimate from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), Phase II. For the first time, it is found that the decadal modulation of EKE is mainly controlled by the barotropic instability of the background flow. During the high-EKE state, violent meanderings efficiently induce strong barotropic energy transfer from mean kinetic energy (MKE) to EKE despite the rather weak jet strength. The reverse is true in the low-EKE state. Although the enhanced meander in the high-EKE state also transfers a significant portion of energy from mean available potential energy (MAPE) to eddy available potential energy (EAPE) through baroclinic instability, the EAPE is not efficiently converted to EKE as the two processes are not well correlated at low frequencies revealed in the time-varying energetics. The decadal modulation of barotropic instability is found to be in pace with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation but with a time lag of approximately 2 years.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ito, Takamitsu</author><author>Wang, Ou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transit Time Distribution based on the ECCO-JPL Ocean Data Assimilation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Marine Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Marine Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>167</volume><keywords><keyword>CFC-11</keyword><keyword>Ocean Data Assimilation</keyword><keyword>Transit Time Distribution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jmarsys.2016.10.015</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ito, T., and O.

The ECCO-JPL circulation provides overall reliable estimates of the upper ocean ventilation rates suitable for biogeochemical studies. Observed distributions of pCFC-11 in the upper ocean thermocline are well reproduced by the convolution integral of the model-based TTD (mean bias&lt;6%, spatial correlation&gt;0.87) but there are significant regional biases in particular near the base of the thermocline and in the deep water formation regions. The model underestimates the deep pCFC-11 (&gt;2000m) in the North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean. The ratio between the mean and the spread of the age spectrum (Γ/Δ) is close to unity (mean=1.04, median=0.99) in the ventilated thermocline of the Pacific basin but there are significant regional variations of the ratio.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abbondanza, Claudio</author><author>Chin, Toshio M.</author><author>Gross, Richard S.</author><author>Heflin, Michael B.</author><author>Parker, Jay W.</author><author>Soja, Benedikt S.</author><author>van Dam, Tonie</author><author>Wu, Xiaoping</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>JTRF2014, the JPL Kalman filter and smoother realization of the International Terrestrial Reference System</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>8474-8510</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Earth rotation</keyword><keyword>GNSS VLBI SLR DORIS</keyword><keyword>Kalman filter</keyword><keyword>Terrestrial Reference Frames</keyword><keyword>geocenter motion</keyword><keyword>time series</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JB014360</electronic-resource-num><notes>Abbondanza, C., T.

Determined through a Kalman filter and Rauch?Tung?Striebel smoother assimilating position observations, Earth orientation parameters, and local ties, JTRF2014 is a subsecular, time series?based TRF whose origin is at the quasi?instantaneous center of mass (CM) as sensed by SLR and whose scale is determined by the quasi?instantaneous VLBI and SLR scales. The dynamical evolution of the positions accounts for a secular motion term, annual, and semiannual periodic modes. Site?dependent variances based on the analysis of loading displacements induced by mass redistributions of terrestrial fluids have been used to control the extent of random walk adopted in the combination. With differences in the amplitude of the annual signal within the range 0.5?0.8 mm, JTRF2014?derived center of network?to?center of mass (CM?CN) is in remarkable agreement with the geocenter motion obtained via spectral inversion of GNSS, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations and modeled ocean bottom pressure from Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO).

Unfortunately, these model outputs are far from perfect and have notable discrepancies with respect to polar motion observations, due to non-uniform distributions of meteorological observatories, as well as theoretical approximations and non-global mass conservation in these models. In this study, the LDC (Least Difference Combination) method is adopted to obtain some improved atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological/crospheric angular momentum (AAM, OAM and HAM/CAM, respectively) functions and excitation functions (termed as the LDCgsm solutions). Various GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and SLR (Satellite Laser Ranging) geopotential data are adopted to correct the non-global mass conservation problem, while polar motion data are used as general constraints. The LDCgsm solutions can reveal not only periodic fluctuations but also secular trends in AAM, OAM and HAM/CAM, and are in better agreement with polar motion observations, reducing the unexplained excitation to the level of about 5.5 mas (standard derivation value; about 1/5–1/4 of those corresponding to the original model outputs).</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Zhang, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global coupled sea ice-ocean state estimation</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>931-956</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>4DVAR</keyword><keyword>Adjoint</keyword><keyword>Assimilation</keyword><keyword>Coupled ocean model</keyword><keyword>ECCO2</keyword><keyword>Sea ice</keyword><keyword>Sea ice concentration data</keyword><keyword>State estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-015-2796-6</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fenty, I., D.

The relative roles of diabatic and adiabatic processes in the volume and heat budgets of the subtropical gyre are investigated by projecting data into temperature coordinates as volumes of water using an Argo-based climatology and an ocean state estimate (ECCO version 4). This highlights that variations in the subtropical gyre volume budget are predominantly set by transport divergence in the gyre. A strong correlation between the volume anomaly due to transport divergence and the variability of both thermocline depth and Ekman pumping over the gyre suggests that wind-driven heave drives transport anomalies at the gyre boundaries. This wind-driven heaving contributes significantly to variations in the heat content of the gyre, as do anomalies in the air–sea fluxes. The analysis presented suggests that wind forcing plays an important role in driving interannual variability in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and that this variability can be unraveled from spatially distributed hydrographic observations using the framework presented here.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Xinfeng</author><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Change of the Global Ocean Vertical Heat Transport over 1993–2010</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>5319-5327</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate variability</keyword><keyword>Data assimilation</keyword><keyword>Decadal variability</keyword><keyword>Mixing</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jcli-d-16-0569.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liang, X., C.

Many patterns of change are consistent with prior studies. However, at various levels above 1800 m the global integral of the change in ocean vertical heat flux involves the summation of positive and negative regional contributions and is not statistically significant. The nonsignificance of change in the global ocean vertical heat transport from an ocean state estimate that provides global coverage and regular sampling, spatially and temporally, raises the question of whether an adequate observational database exists to assess changes in the upper ocean heat content over the past few decades. Also, whereas the advective term largely determines the spatial pattern of the change in ocean vertical heat flux, its global integral is not significantly different from zero. In contrast, the diffusive term, although regionally weak except in high-latitude oceans, produces a statistically significant extra downward heat flux during the 2000s. This result suggests that besides ocean advection, ocean mixing processes, including isopycnal and diapycnal as well as convective mixing, are important for the decadal variation of the heat exchange between upper and deep oceans as well. Furthermore, the analyses herein indicate that focusing on any particular region in explaining changes of the global ocean heat content is misleading.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Xinfeng</author><author>Spall, Michael</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Ocean Vertical Velocity From a Dynamically Consistent Ocean State Estimate</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>8208-8224</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>4220 Coral reef systems</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4279 Upwelling and convergences</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>ocean state estimate</keyword><keyword>vertical exchange</keyword><keyword>vertical transport</keyword><keyword>vertical velocity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC012985</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liang, X., M.

Conventional patterns of vertical velocity, Ekman pumping, appear in the upper ocean, with topographic dominance at depth. Intense and vertically coherent upwelling and downwelling occur in the Southern Ocean, which are likely due to the interaction of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and large-scale topographic features and are generally canceled out in the conventional zonally averaged results. These “elevators” at high latitudes connect the upper to the deep and abyssal oceans and working together with isopycnal mixing are likely a mechanism, in addition to the formation of deep and abyssal waters, for fast responses of the deep and abyssal oceans to the changing climate. Also, Eulerian and parameterized eddy-induced components are of opposite signs in numerous regions around the global ocean, particularly in the ocean interior away from surface and bottom. Nevertheless, residual vertical velocity is primarily determined by the Eulerian component, and related to winds and large-scale topographic features. The current estimates of vertical velocities can serve as a useful reference for investigating the vertical exchange of ocean properties and tracers, and its complex spatial structure ultimately permits regional tests of basic oceanographic concepts such as Sverdrup balance and coastal upwelling/downwelling.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Little, Christopher M</author><author>Buckley, Martha W</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms underlying recent decadal changes in subpolar North Atlantic Ocean heat content</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>7181-7197</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>1616 Climate variability</keyword><keyword>3305 Climate change and variability</keyword><keyword>4513 Decadal ocean variability</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>Atlantic multidecadal variability</keyword><keyword>Sverdrup balance</keyword><keyword>decadal variability</keyword><keyword>heat content</keyword><keyword>ocean state estimation</keyword><keyword>overturning circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC012845</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

In 2004–2005, SPNA decadal upper ocean and sea-surface temperature trends reversed from warming during 1994–2004 to cooling over 2005–2015. This recent decadal trend reversal in SPNA ocean heat content (OHC) is studied using a physically consistent, observationally constrained global ocean state estimate covering 1992–2015. The estimate's physical consistency facilitates quantitative causal attribution of ocean variations. Closed heat budget diagnostics reveal that the SPNA OHC trend reversal is the result of heat advection by midlatitude ocean circulation. Kinematic decompositions reveal that changes in the deep and intermediate vertical overturning circulation cannot account for the trend reversal, but rather ocean heat transports by horizontal gyre circulations render the primary contributions. The shift in horizontal gyre advection reflects anomalous circulation acting on the mean temperature gradients. Maximum covariance analysis (MCA) reveals strong covariation between the anomalous horizontal gyre circulation and variations in the local wind stress curl, suggestive of a Sverdrup response. Results have implications for decadal predictability.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Chen, Shuiming</author><author>Schneider, Niklas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamical Links between the Decadal Variability of the Oyashio and Kuroshio Extensions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>9591-9605</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Advection</keyword><keyword>Atmosphere-ocean interaction</keyword><keyword>Boundary currents</keyword><keyword>Decadal variability</keyword><keyword>Fronts</keyword><keyword>Oceanic variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jcli-d-17-0397.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Qiu, B., S.

With a mean latitude along 40°N, the western OE front exists primarily west of 153°E and is a continuation of the subarctic gyre western boundary current. The eastern OE front, also appearing along 40°N, is located between 153° and 170°E, whose entity is disconnected from its western counterpart. During 1982–2016, both of the OE fronts exhibit prominent decadal fluctuations, although their signals show little contemporaneous correlation. An upper-ocean temperature budget analysis based on the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, phase II (ECCO2), state estimate reveals that the advective temperature flux convergence plays a critical role in determining the low-frequency temperature changes relating to the OE fronts. Specifically, the western OE front variability is controlled by the decadal mesoscale eddy modulations in the upstream Kuroshio Extension (KE). An enhanced eddy activity increases the poleward heat transport and works to strengthen the western OE front. The eastern OE front variability, on the other hand, is dictated by both the meridional shift of the KE position and the circulation intensity change immediately north of the eastern OE. Different baroclinic adjustment speeds for the KE and OE are found to cause the in-phase changes between these latter two processes. Lack of contemporaneous correlation between the decadal western and eastern OE variability is found to be related to the interaction of the meridionally migrating KE jet with the Shatsky Rise near 159°E.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rosso, Isabella</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Verdy, Ariane</author><author>Talley, Lynne D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Space and time variability of the Southern Ocean carbon budget</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>7407-7432</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>and modeling</keyword><keyword>carbon budget</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword><keyword>state estimate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012646</electronic-resource-num><notes>Rosso, I., M.

The relative importance of these mechanisms in the Southern Ocean is uncertain, as year-round observations in this area have been limited. We use a novel physical-biogeochemical state estimate of the Southern Ocean to construct a closed DIC budget of the top 650 m and investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the different components of the carbon system. The dominant mechanisms of variability in upper ocean DIC depend on location and time and space scales considered. Advective transport is the most influential mechanism and governs the local DIC budget across the 10 day–5 year timescales analyzed. Diffusive effects are nearly negligible. The large-scale transport structure is primarily set by upwelling and downwelling, though both the lateral ageostrophic and geostrophic transports are significant. In the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the carbon budget components are also influenced by the presence of topography and biological hot spots. In the subtropics, evaporation and air-sea CO2 flux primarily balances the sink due to biological production and advective transport. Finally, in the subpolar region sea ice processes, which change the seawater volume and thus the DIC concentration, compensate the large impact of the advective transport and modulate the timing of biological activity and air-sea CO2 flux.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Storto, Andrea</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Balmaseda, Magdalena</author><author>Guinehut, Stéphanie</author><author>Xue, Yan</author><author>Szekely, Tanguy</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Chang, You-Soon</author><author>Good, Simon A</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Vernieres, Guillaume</author><author>Ferry, Nicolas</author><author>Peterson, K Andrew</author><author>Behringer, David</author><author>Ishii, Masayoshi</author><author>Masuda, Shuhei</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Toyoda, Takahiro</author><author>Yin, Yonghong</author><author>Valdivieso, Maria</author><author>Barnier, Bernard</author><author>Boyer, Tim</author><author>Lee, Tony</author><author>Gourrion, Jérome</author><author>Wang, Ou</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Rosati, Anthony</author><author>Kovach, Robin</author><author>Hernandez, Fabrice</author><author>Martin, Matthew J</author><author>Kamachi, Masafumi</author><author>Kuragano, Tsurane</author><author>Mogensen, Kristian</author><author>Alves, Oscar</author><author>Haines, Keith</author><author>Wang, Xiaochun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Steric sea level variability (1993–2010) in an ensemble of ocean reanalyses and objective analyses</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>709-729</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-015-2554-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>Storto, A., et al.

In this work, as part of the Ocean Reanalysis Intercomparison Project, the global and regional steric sea level changes are estimated and compared from an ensemble of 16 ocean reanalyses and 4 objective analyses. These estimates are initially compared with a satellite-derived (altimetry minus gravimetry) dataset for a short period (2003–2010). The ensemble mean exhibits a significant high correlation at both global and regional scale, and the ensemble of ocean reanalyses outperforms that of objective analyses, in particular in the Southern Ocean. The reanalysis ensemble mean thus represents a valuable tool for further analyses, although large uncertainties remain for the inter-annual trends. Within the extended intercomparison period that spans the altimetry era (1993–2010), we find that the ensemble of reanalyses and objective analyses are in good agreement, and both detect a trend of the global steric sea level of 1.0 and 1.1 ± 0.05 mm/year, respectively. However, the spread among the products of the halosteric component trend exceeds the mean trend itself, questioning the reliability of its estimate. This is related to the scarcity of salinity observations before the Argo era. Furthermore, the impact of deep ocean layers is non-negligible on the steric sea level variability (22 and 12 % for the layers below 700 and 1500 m of depth, respectively), although the small deep ocean trends are not significant with respect to the products spread.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Toyoda, Takahiro</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Kuragano, Tsurane</author><author>Kamachi, Masafumi</author><author>Ishikawa, Yoichi</author><author>Masuda, Shuhei</author><author>Sato, Kanako</author><author>Awaji, Toshiyuki</author><author>Hernandez, Fabrice</author><author>Ferry, Nicolas</author><author>Guinehut, Stéphanie</author><author>Martin, Matthew J</author><author>Peterson, K Andrew</author><author>Good, Simon A</author><author>Valdivieso, Maria</author><author>Haines, Keith</author><author>Storto, Andrea</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Zuo, Hao</author><author>Balmaseda, Magdalena</author><author>Yin, Yonghong</author><author>Shi, Li</author><author>Alves, Oscar</author><author>Smith, Gregory</author><author>Chang, You-Soon</author><author>Vernieres, Guillaume</author><author>Wang, Xiaochun</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Wang, Ou</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Lee, Tong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intercomparison and validation of the mixed layer depth fields of global ocean syntheses</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>753-773</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-015-2637-7</electronic-resource-num><notes>Toyoda, T., et al.

Compared with the reference MLDs calculated from individual profiles, MLDs calculated from monthly mean and gridded profiles show negative biases of 10–20 m in early spring related to the re-stratification process of relatively deep mixed layers. Vertical resolution of profiles also influences the MLD estimation. MLDs are underestimated by approximately 5–7 (14–16) m with the vertical resolution of 25 (50) m when the criterion of potential density exceeding the 10-m value by 0.03 kg m−3 is used for the MLD estimation. Using the larger criterion (0.125 kg m−3) generally reduces the underestimations. In addition, positive biases greater than 100 m are found in wintertime subpolar regions when MLD criteria based on temperature are used. Biases of the reanalyses are due to both model errors and errors related to differences between the assimilation methods. The result shows that these errors are partially cancelled out through the ensemble averaging. Moreover, the bias in the ensemble mean field of the reanalyses is smaller than in the observation-only analyses. This is largely attributed to comparably higher resolutions of the reanalyses. The robust reproduction of both the seasonal cycle and interannual variability by the ensemble mean of the reanalyses indicates a great potential of the ensemble mean MLD field for investigating and monitoring upper ocean processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Toyoda, Takahiro</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Kuragano, Tsurane</author><author>Kosugi, Naohiro</author><author>Sasano, Daisuke</author><author>Kamachi, Masafumi</author><author>Ishikawa, Yoichi</author><author>Masuda, Shuhei</author><author>Sato, Kanako</author><author>Awaji, Toshiyuki</author><author>Hernandez, Fabrice</author><author>Ferry, Nicolas</author><author>Guinehut, Stéphanie</author><author>Martin, Matthew</author><author>Andrew Peterson, K</author><author>Good, Simon A</author><author>Valdivieso, Maria</author><author>Haines, Keith</author><author>Storto, Andrea</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Yin, Yonghong</author><author>Shi, Li</author><author>Alves, Oscar</author><author>Smith, Gregory</author><author>Chang, You-Soon</author><author>Vernieres, Guillaume</author><author>Wang, Xiaochun</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Wang, Ou</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Zuo, Hao</author><author>Balmaseda, Magdalena</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual-decadal variability of wintertime mixed layer depths in the North Pacific detected by an ensemble of ocean syntheses</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>891-907</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-015-2762-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Toyoda, T., et al.

The first leading EOF mode represents the interannual MLD anomalies centered in the eastern part of the central mode water formation region in phase opposition with those in the eastern subtropics and the central Alaskan Gyre. This first EOF mode is highly correlated with the Pacific decadal oscillation index on both the interannual and decadal time scales. The second leading EOF mode represents the MLD variability in the subtropical mode water (STMW) formation region and has a good correlation with the wintertime West Pacific (WP) index with time lag of 3 years, suggesting the importance of the oceanic dynamical response to the change in the surface wind field associated with the meridional shifts of the Aleutian Low. The above MLD variabilities are in basic agreement with previous observational and modeling findings. Moreover the reanalysis ensemble provides uncertainty estimates. The interannual MLD anomalies in the first and second EOF modes are consistently represented by the individual reanalyses and the amplitudes of the variabilities generally exceed the ensemble spread of the reanalyses. Besides, the resulting MLD variability indices, spanning the 1948–2012 period, should be helpful for characterizing the North Pacific climate variability. In particular, a 6-year oscillation including the WP teleconnection pattern in the atmosphere and the oceanic MLD variability in the STMW formation region is first detected.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Verdy, A</author><author>Mazloff, M R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A data assimilating model for estimating Southern Ocean biogeochemistry</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>6968-6988</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>0414 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>and modeling</keyword><keyword>biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012650</electronic-resource-num><notes>Verdy, A., and M.

The state estimate is constrained with observations while maintaining closed budgets and obeying dynamical and thermodynamic balances. Observations from profiling floats, shipboard data, underway measurements, and satellites are used for assimilation. The years 2008–2012 are chosen due to the relative abundance of oxygen observations from Argo floats during this time. The skill of the state estimate at fitting the data is assessed. The agreement is best for fields that are constrained with the most observations, such as surface pCO2 in Drake Passage (44% of the variance captured) and oxygen profiles (over 60% of the variance captured at 200 and 1000 m). The validity of adjoint method optimization for coupled physical-biogeochemical state estimation is demonstrated with a series of gradient check experiments. The method is shown to be mature and ready to synthesize in situ biogeochemical observations as they become more available. Documenting the B-SOSE configuration and diagnosing the strengths and weaknesses of the solution informs usage of this product as both a climate baseline and as a way to test hypotheses. Transport of Intermediate Waters across 32°S supplies significant amounts of nitrate to the Atlantic Ocean (5.57 ± 2.94 Tmol yr−1) and Indian Ocean (5.09 ± 3.06 Tmol yr−1), but much less nitrate reaches the Pacific Ocean (1.78 ± 1.91 Tmol yr−1). Estimates of air-sea carbon dioxide fluxes south of 50°S suggest a mean uptake of 0.18 Pg C/yr for the time period analyzed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Quran</author><author>Zhang, Xuebin</author><author>Church, John A</author><author>Hu, Jianyu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability and change of sea level and its components in the Indo-Pacific region during the altimetry era</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>1862-1881</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>1641 Sea level change</keyword><keyword>4513 Decadal ocean variability</keyword><keyword>4522 ENSO</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>interannual and decadal variability</keyword><keyword>linear trend</keyword><keyword>mass-induced sea level</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword><keyword>steric sea level</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012345</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wu, Q., X.

A better understanding of those low-frequency sea level variations benefits the detection and attribution of climate change signals. Nonetheless, the contributions of thermosteric, halosteric, and mass sea level components to sea level variability and trend patterns remain unclear. By focusing on signals associated with dominant climate modes in the Indo-Pacific region, we estimate the interannual and decadal fingerprints and trend of each sea level component utilizing a multivariate linear regression of two adjoint-based ocean reanalyses. Sea level interannual, decadal, and trend patterns primarily come from thermosteric sea level (TSSL). Halosteric sea level (HSSL) is of regional importance in the Pacific Ocean on decadal time scale and dominates sea level trends in the northeast subtropical Pacific. The compensation between TSSL and HSSL is identified in their decadal variability and trends. The interannual and decadal variability of temperature generally peak at subsurface around 100 m but that of salinity tend to be surface-intensified. Decadal temperature and salinity signals extend deeper into the ocean in some regions than their interannual equivalents. Mass sea level (MassSL) is critical for the interannual and decadal variability of sea level over shelf seas. Inconsistencies exist in MassSL trend patterns among various estimates. This study highlights regions where multiple processes work together to control sea level variability and change. Further work is required to better understand the interaction of different processes in those regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nicholson, D P</author><author>Khatiwala, S</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Noble gas tracers of ventilation during deep-water formation in the Weddell Sea</title></titles><periodical/><pages>12011-12019</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><urls/></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, Nadya</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Durack, Paul</author><author>Boutin, Jacqueline</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Salinity and the Water Cycle: Recent Progress and Future Challenges</title><secondary-title>GEWEX News</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEWEX News</full-title></periodical><pages>6-8</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><notes>Vinogradova, N., T.

Model forcing is from monthly reconstructions of ocean state and ice sheet runoff. Results are analyzed in combination with observations of bathymetry, bed elevation, ice front retreat, and glacier speed. We calculate that subaqueous melt rates are 2?3 times larger in summer compared to winter and doubled in magnitude since the 1990s due to enhanced subglacial runoff and 1.6 ± 0.3°C warmer ocean temperature. Umiamako and Kangilerngata retreated rapidly in the 2000s when subaqueous melt rates exceeded the calving rates and ice front retreated to deeper bed elevation. In contrast, Store, Kangerdlugssup, and Rinks have remained stable because their subaqueous melt rates are 3?4 times lower than their calving rates, i.e., the glaciers are dominated by calving processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashkezari, Mohammad D.</author><author>Hill, Christopher N.</author><author>Follett, Christopher N.</author><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic eddy detection and lifetime forecast using machine learning methods</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>12,212-234,241</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>eddy</keyword><keyword>eddy lifetime</keyword><keyword>machine learning</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>remote sensing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016GL071269</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ashkezari, M.

The machine learning models use daily maps of geostrophic velocity anomalies and are trained according to the phase angle between the zonal and meridional components at each grid point. The trained models are then used to identify the corresponding eddy phase patterns and to predict the lifetime of a detected eddy structure. The performance of the proposed method is examined at two dynamically different regions to demonstrate its robust behavior and region independency.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nie, Xunwei</author><author>Gao, Shan</author><author>Wang, Fan</author><author>Qu, Tangdong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subduction of North Pacific Tropical Water and its equatorward pathways as shown by a simulated passive tracer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>8770-8786</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>North Pacific Tropical Water</keyword><keyword>mixing</keyword><keyword>pathway</keyword><keyword>resurface</keyword><keyword>subduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><isbn>0022-3670</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012305</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nie, X., S.

The results show that approximately 5.8 Sv (1 Sv [ 106m3 s-1) of the SPTW is formed in the subtropical South Pacific Ocean within the density range between 24.0 and 25.0 kgm-3, of which about 87% is due to vertical pumping and 13% is due to lateral induction, comparing reasonably well with estimates from climatological data. Once subducted, most SPTW spreads in the subtropical South Pacific. Because of the presence of mixing, some portion of the water is transformed, and its tracer-weighted density steadily increases from an initial value of 24.4 to nearly 25.0 kgm-3 after 13 years of integration. Approximately 42% of the water makes its way into the equatorial Pacific, either through the western boundary or interior pathway. The two equatorward pathways are essentially of equal importance. A large (~70%) portion of the SPTW entering the equatorial region resurfaces in the central equatorial Pacific. The potential impacts of the resurfacing SPTW on the equatorial thermocline and surface stratification are discussed. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bender, Peter L.</author><author>Betts, Casey R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean calibration approach for data from the GRACE Follow‐On mission</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>1218-1235</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO‐JPL ocean model</keyword><keyword>GRACE Follow‐On mission</keyword><keyword>geopotential variations at satellite altitude</keyword><keyword>mass distribution variations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JB012433</electronic-resource-num><notes>Bender, P.

In addition, the GRACE Follow?On mission is scheduled to be flown soon after the end of life of the GRACE mission in order to minimize the loss of valuable data on the Earth's gravity field changes. In view of the major benefits to hydrology and oceanography, as well as to other fields, it is desirable to investigate the fundamental limits to monitoring the time variations in the Earth's gravity field during GRACE?type missions. A simplified model is presented in this paper for making estimates of the effect of differential spurious accelerations of the satellites during times when four successive revolutions cross the Pacific Ocean. The analysis approach discussed is to make use of changes in the satellite separation observed during passages across low?latitude regions of the Pacific and of other oceans to correct for spurious accelerations of the satellites. The low?latitude regions of the Pacific and of other oceans are the extended regions where the a priori uncertainties in the time variations of the geopotential heights due to mass distribution changes are known best. In addition, advantage can be taken of the repeated crossings of the South Pole and the North Pole, since the uncertainties in changes in the geopotential heights at the poles during the time required for four orbit revolutions are likely to be small.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vondrak, Jan</author><author>Ron, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical fluids from different data sources, geomagnetic jerks, and their impact on Earth´s orientation</title><secondary-title>Acta Geodynamica et Geomaterialia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Geodynamica et Geomaterialia</full-title></periodical><pages>241-247</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.13168/AGG.2016.0005</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vondrak, J., and C.

Here we concentrate on other available models of geophysical fluids, such as ERA and MERRA for the atmosphere, and OMCT for the oceans, and compare the results obtained with all of them. We also test the hypothetic effect of geomagnetic jerks together with these alternative models and study how much the agreement with the observed Earth Orientation Parameters is improved. By using numerical integration of all five Earth orientation parameters, we demonstrate that different models of atmospheric/oceanic excitations lead to slightly different results, fitting relatively well with their observed values but showing changes both in amplitude and phase. In all cases the agreement improves substantially when the effect of geomagnetic jerks is added to geophysical fluids, and the differences in amplitude/phase almost disappear.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Weiwei</author><author>van Dam, Tonie</author><author>Li, Zhao</author><author>Shen, Yunzhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Annual variation detected by GPS, GRACE and loading models</title><secondary-title>Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica</full-title></periodical><pages>608-621</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11200-016-0205-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Li, W., T. van Dam, Z.

This paper compares the annual signals of the GPS position time series from the Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS), estimates of loading from GRACE monthly gravity field models calculated by three processing centers (Center of Spatial Research, CSR; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL; GeoForschungsZentrum, GFZ) and three geophysical fluids models (National Center for Environmental Prediction, NCEP; Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, ECCO; Global Land Data Assimilation System, GLDAS) for 270 globally distributed stations for the period 2003-2011. The results show that annual variations derived from the level-2 products from the three GRACE product centers are very similar. The absolute difference in annual amplitude between any two centers is never larger than 1.25 mm in the vertical and 0.11 mm in horizontal displacement. The mean phase differences of the GRACE results are less than ten days for all three components. When we correct the GPS vertical coordinate time series using the GRACE annual amplitudes using the products from three GRACE analysis centers, we find that we are able to reduce the GPS annual signal in the vertical at about 80% stations and the average reduction is about 47%. In the north and the east, the annual amplitude is reduced on 77% and 72% of the stations with the average reduction 32% and 33%. We also compare the annual surface displacement signal derived from two environmental models; the two models use the same atmospheric and non-tidal ocean loading and differ only in the continental water storage model that we use, either NCEP or GLDAS. We find that the model containing the GLDAS continental water storage is able to better reduce the annual signal in the GPS coordinate time series.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Ying</author><author>Du, Yan</author><author>Zhang, Yuhong</author><author>Gao, Shan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Asymmetry of upper ocean salinity response to the Indian Ocean dipole events as seen from ECCO simulation</title><secondary-title>Acta Oceanologica Sinica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Oceanologica Sinica</full-title></periodical><pages>42-49</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13131-016-0904-z</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhang, Y., Y.

The results show that salinity anomalies in the upper ocean are asymmetrically associated with the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events, with stronger response during their positive phases. Further investigations reveal that zonal currents along the equator, the Wyrtki jets, dominate the salinity transport. During the positive IOD events, the Wyrtki jets have stronger westward anomalies. The positive skewness of the IOD explains that the amplitude of the anomalous Wyrtki jets is stronger in the positive IOD events than that in the negative events.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chaudhuri, A H</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Forget, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of uncertainties in atmospheric boundary conditions on ocean model solutions</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>96-108</pages><volume>100</volume><keywords><keyword>Atmospheric uncertainty</keyword><keyword>Global ocean modeling</keyword><keyword>Reanalysis</keyword><keyword>arctic-ocean</keyword><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>equatorial pacific</keyword><keyword>era-interim</keyword><keyword>fluxes</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword><keyword>sea-ice</keyword><keyword>simulations</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2016.02.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chaudhuri, A.

For this purpose, we use a global configuration of the MITgcm to simulate 4 ocean solutions for 2000-2009 using 4 reanalysis products (JRA-25, MERRA, CFSR and ERA-Interim) as atmospheric forcing. The simulations are compared against observations and against each other for selected variables (temperature, sea-level, sea-ice, streamfunctions, meridional heat and freshwater transports). Forcing-induced differences are comparable in magnitude to model-observation misfits for most near-surface variables in the tropics and sub-tropics, but typically smaller at higher latitudes and polar regions. Forcing-derived differences are expectedly largest near the surface and mostly limited to the upper 1000 m but can also be seen as deep as 4000 m, especially in regions of deep water formation. Errors are not necessarily local in nature and can be advected to different basins. Results indicate that while forcing adjustments might suffice in optimization procedures of near-surface fields and at low-to-mid latitudes, other control parameters are likely needed elsewhere. Forcing-induced differences can be dominated by large spatial scales and specific time scales (e.g. annual), and thus appropriate error covariances in space and time need to be considered in optimization methodologies.

Atmospheric deposition provides a relatively large influx of new nutrients and trace metals to the surface ocean in this region in comparison to other nutrient sources. However, the impact on native phytoplankton is muted due to the high ratio of nitrogen (N) to P (NO3:SRP &gt; 40) and the low P solubility of these aerosols. Atmospheric deposition induces P limitation in this LNLC region by adding more N and iron (Fe) relative to P. This favors the growth of Prochlorococcus, a genus characterized by low P requirements and highly efficient P acquisition mechanisms. A global three-dimensional marine ecosystem model that includes species-specific phytoplankton elemental quotas/stoichiometry and the atmospheric deposition of N, P, and Fe supports this conclusion. Future increases in aerosol N loading may therefore influence phytoplankton community structure in other LNLC areas, thereby affecting the biological pump and associated carbon sequestration.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danabasoglu, Gokhan</author><author>Yeager, Steve G</author><author>Kim, Who M</author><author>Behrens, Erik</author><author>Bentsen, Mats</author><author>Bi, Daohua</author><author>Biastoch, Arne</author><author>Bleck, Rainer</author><author>Böning, Claus</author><author>Bozec, Alexandra</author><author>Canuto, Vittorio M</author><author>Cassou, Christophe</author><author>Chassignet, Eric</author><author>Coward, Andrew C</author><author>Danilov, Sergey</author><author>Diansky, Nikolay</author><author>Drange, Helge</author><author>Farneti, Riccardo</author><author>Fernandez, Elodie</author><author>Fogli, Pier Giuseppe</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Griffies, Stephen M</author><author>Gusev, Anatoly</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Howard, Armando</author><author>Ilicak, Mehmet</author><author>Jung, Thomas</author><author>Karspeck, Alicia R</author><author>Kelley, Maxwell</author><author>Large, William G</author><author>Leboissetier, Anthony</author><author>Lu, Jianhua</author><author>Madec, Gurvan</author><author>Marsland, Simon J</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Navarra, Antonio</author><author>Nurser, A J George</author><author>Pirani, Anna</author><author>Romanou, Anastasia</author><author>Salas y Mélia, David</author><author>Samuels, Bonita L</author><author>Scheinert, Markus</author><author>Sidorenko, Dmitry</author><author>Sun, Shan</author><author>Treguier, Anne-Marie</author><author>Tsujino, Hiroyuki</author><author>Uotila, Petteri</author><author>Valcke, Sophie</author><author>Voldoire, Aurore</author><author>Wang, Qiang</author><author>Yashayaev, Igor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>North Atlantic simulations in Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments phase II (CORE-II).

These simulations are performed as contributions to the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II). The study is Part II of our companion paper (Danabasoglu et al., 2014) which documented the mean states in the North Atlantic from the same models. A major focus of the present study is the representation of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) variability in the participating models. Relationships between AMOC variability and those of some other related variables, such as subpolar mixed layer depths, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Labrador Sea upper-ocean hydrographic properties, are also investigated. In general, AMOC variability shows three distinct stages. During the first stage that lasts until the mid- to late-1970s, AMOC is relatively steady, remaining lower than its long-term (1958–2007) mean. Thereafter, AMOC intensifies with maximum transports achieved in the mid- to late-1990s. This enhancement is then followed by a weakening trend until the end of our integration period. This sequence of low frequency AMOC variability is consistent with previous studies. Regarding strengthening of AMOC between about the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, our results support a previously identified variability mechanism where AMOC intensification is connected to increased deep water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic, driven by NAO-related surface fluxes. The simulations tend to show general agreement in their temporal representations of, for example, AMOC, sea surface temperature (SST), and subpolar mixed layer depth variabilities. In particular, the observed variability of the North Atlantic SSTs is captured well by all models. These findings indicate that simulated variability and trends are primarily dictated by the atmospheric datasets which include the influence of ocean dynamics from nature superimposed onto anthropogenic effects. Despite these general agreements, there are many differences among the model solutions, particularly in the spatial structures of variability patterns.

SAMW ventilates the subtropical thermocline on decadal timescales, providing nutrients for low-latitude productivity and potentially trapping anthropogenic carbon in the deep ocean interior for centuries. In this work, we investigate the spatial structure and timescales of mode water export and associated thermocline ventilation. We use passive tracers in an eddy-permitting, observationally-informed Southern Ocean model to identify the pathways followed by mode waters between their formation regions and the areas where they first enter the subtropics. We find that the pathways followed by the mode water tracers are largely set by the mean geostrophic circulation. Export from the Indian and Central Pacific mode water pools is primarily driven by large-scale gyre circulation, whereas export from the Australian and Atlantic pools is heavily influenced by the ACC. Export from the Eastern Pacific mode water pool is driven by a combination of deep boundary currents and subtropical gyre circulation. More than 50% of each mode water tracer reaches the subtropical thermocline within 50 years, with significant variability between pools. The Eastern Pacific pathway is especially efficient, with roughly 80% entering the subtropical thermocline within 50 years. The time required for 50% of the mode water tracers to leave the Southern Ocean domain varies significantly between mode water pools, from 9 years for the Indian mode water pool to roughly 40 years for the Central Pacific mode water pool.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyssignac, B</author><author>Piecuch, C G</author><author>Merchant, C J</author><author>Racault, M.-F.</author><author>Palanisamy, H</author><author>MacIntosh, C</author><author>Sathyendranath, S</author><author>Brewin, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Causes of the Regional Variability in Observed Sea Level, Sea Surface Temperature and Ocean Colour Over the Period 1993–2011</title><secondary-title>Surveys in Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surveys in Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-29</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10712-016-9383-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Meyssignac, B., C.

The analysis focuses on the signature of the ocean large-scale climate fluctuations driven by the atmospheric forcing and do not address the mesoscale variability. We use the ECCO version 4 ocean reanalysis to unravel the role of ocean transport and surface buoyancy fluxes in the observed SSH, SST and OC variability. We show that the SSH regional variability is dominated by the steric effect (except at high latitude) and is mainly shaped by ocean heat transport divergences with some contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing that can be significant regionally (confirming earlier results). This is in contrast with the SST regional variability, which is the result of the compensation of surface heat fluxes by ocean heat transport in the mixed layer and arises from small departures around this background balance. Bringing together the results of SSH and SST analyses, we show that SSH and SST bear some common variability. This is because both SSH and SST variability show significant contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing. It is evidenced by the high correlation between SST and buoyancy-forced SSH almost everywhere in the ocean except at high latitude. OC, which is determined by phytoplankton biomass, is governed by the availability of light and nutrients that essentially depend on climate fluctuations. For this reason, OC shows significant correlation with SST and SSH. We show that the correlation with SST displays the same pattern as the correlation with SSH with a negative correlation in the tropics and subtropics and a positive correlation at high latitude. We discuss the reasons for this pattern.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ngeve, Magdalene N</author><author>Van der Stocken, Tom</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Koedam, Nico</author><author>Triest, Ludwig</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contrasting Effects of Historical Sea Level Rise and Contemporary Ocean Currents on Regional Gene Flow of Rhizophora racemosa in Eastern Atlantic Mangroves</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e0150950</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0150950</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ngeve, M.

Therefore, investigating their patterns of gene flow provides insights on the processes involved in the spatial genetic structuring of populations. The coastline of Cameroon has a particular geomorphological history and coastal hydrology with complex contemporary patterns of ocean currents, which we hypothesize to have effects on the spatial configuration and composition of present-day mangroves within its spans. A total of 982 trees were sampled from 33 transects (11 sites) in 4 estuaries. Using 11 polymorphic SSR markers, we investigated genetic diversity and structure of Rhizophora racemosa, a widespread species in the region. Genetic diversity was low to moderate and genetic differentiation between nearly all population pairs was significant. Bayesian clustering analysis, PCoA, estimates of contemporary migration rates and identification of barriers to gene flow were used and complemented with estimated dispersal trajectories of hourly released virtual propagules, using high-resolution surface current from a mesoscale and tide-resolving ocean simulation. These indicate that the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL) is not a present-day barrier to gene flow. Rather, the Inter-Bioko-Cameroon (IBC) corridor, formed due to sea level rise, allows for connectivity between two mangrove areas that were isolated during glacial times by the CVL. Genetic data and numerical ocean simulations indicated that an oceanic convergence zone near the Cameroon Estuary complex (CEC) presents a strong barrier to gene flow, resulting in genetic discontinuities between the mangrove areas on either side. This convergence did not result in higher genetic diversity at the CEC as we had hypothesized. In conclusion, the genetic structure of Rhizophora racemosa is maintained by the contrasting effects of the contemporary oceanic convergence and historical climate change-induced sea level rise.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nie, Xunwei</author><author>Gao, Shan</author><author>Wang, Fan</author><author>Qu, Tangdong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subduction of North Pacific Tropical Water and its equatorward pathways as shown by a simulated passive tracer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>8770-8786</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4283 Water masses</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>4576 Western boundary currents</keyword><keyword>North Pacific Tropical Water</keyword><keyword>mixing</keyword><keyword>pathway</keyword><keyword>resurface</keyword><keyword>subduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012305</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nie, X., S.

The results demonstrate that the subduction of NPTW occurs in a large area that extends from about 150°E to 130°W between 20°N and 30°N, but the main subduction region lies in its eastern part. After subduction, the main body of NPTW first spreads westward in the North Equatorial Current. Then it splits into two branches. One flows northward in the Kuroshio upon reaching the western boundary, and the other enters the tropical Pacific either via its western boundary pathway (WBP) or interior pathway (IP). Less than half of the transport through the WBP can eventually reach the central and eastern Pacific by the Equatorial Undercurrent, while the rest is seen to flow into the Indian Ocean by the Indonesian Throughflow. The IP is found to play a significant role in equatorward transport of the NPTW. About 30% of the NPTW that reached the equatorial Pacific is transported through the IP.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ocaña, Victor</author><author>Zorita, Eduardo</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stochastic secular trends in sea level rise</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>2183-2202</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>1641 Sea level change</keyword><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>autoregressive/integrated process</keyword><keyword>ocean variability</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JC011301</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ocaña, V., E.

Several studies that attempt to explain the long-term trend of GMSL during the instrumental record share the common assumption that this trend is deterministic in nature and different from natural variations. Here we show that the trend can alternatively be explained, at least in part, as being caused by random variations within the coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere system, and hence not having a deterministic origin. These random trends, which add to externally forced changes (e.g., through anthropogenic climate change), are a consequence of the integrated character of GMSL, which is the cumulative addition of temporal contributions that exhibit random character, and whose integration results in GMSL variations with persistence on decadal-centennial time scales. The generation of trends by integration of random stationary noise (i.e., even in a constant climate) is a robust and fundamental feature of stochastically forced systems with memory. The integrated character of GMSL results in an intrinsic difficulty in distinguishing internal from externally forced trends.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Dangendorf, Sönke</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Marcos, Marta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Annual Sea Level Changes on the North American Northeast Coast: Influence of Local Winds and Barotropic Motions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>4801-4816</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Atm/Ocean Structure/ Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Barotropic flows</keyword><keyword>Circulation/ Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Decadal variability</keyword><keyword>Geographic location/entity</keyword><keyword>Interannual variability</keyword><keyword>North Atlantic Ocean</keyword><keyword>Ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>Sea level</keyword><keyword>Variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0048.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

In this study, annual sea level records (adjusted for the inverted barometer effect) from tide gauges along the North American northeast coast over 1980–2010 are compared to a set of data-assimilating ocean reanalysis products as well as a global barotropic model solution forced with wind stress and barometric pressure. Correspondence between models and data depends strongly on model and location. At sites north of Cape Hatteras, the barotropic model shows as much (if not more) skill than ocean reanalyses, explaining about 50% of the variance in the adjusted annual tide gauge sea level records. Additional numerical experiments show that annual sea level changes along this coast from the barotropic model are driven by local wind stress over the continental shelf and slope. This result is interpreted in the light of a simple dynamic framework, wherein bottom friction balances surface wind stress in the alongshore direction and geostrophy holds in the across-shore direction. Results highlight the importance of barotropic dynamics on coastal sea level changes on interannual and decadal time scales; they also have implications for diagnosing the uncertainties in current ocean reanalyses, using tide gauge records to infer past changes in ocean circulation, and identifying the physical mechanisms responsible for projected future regional sea level rise.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pillar, Helen R</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Johnson, Helen L</author><author>Marshall, David P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamical attribution of recent variability in Atlantic overturning</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3339-3352</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Circulation/ Dynamics,Atmosphere-ocean interaction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0727.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Pillar, H.

At scales between 10 and 200 km, the ADCP kinetic energy spectra approximately follow a k−3 power law. The observed flows are more energetic at the surface, but the shape of the kinetic energy spectra is independent of depth. These characteristics resemble predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The ratio of across-track to along-track kinetic energy spectra, however, significantly departs from the expectation of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The inconsistency is dramatic at scales smaller than 40 km. A Helmholtz decomposition of the ADCP spectra and analyses of synthetic and numerical model data show that horizontally divergent, ageostrophic flows account for the discrepancy between the observed spectra and predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. In Drake Passage, ageostrophic motions appear to be dominated by inertia–gravity waves and account for about half of the near-surface kinetic energy at scales between 10 and 40 km. Model results indicate that ageostrophic flows imprint on the sea surface, accounting for about half of the sea surface height variance between 10 and 40 km.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scharffenberg, Martin G</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Testing the Quality of Sea-Level Data Using the GECCO Adjoint Assimilation Approach</title><secondary-title>Surveys in Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surveys in Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-35</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10712-016-9401-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Scharffenberg, M.

Based on decreased GECCO2 model–data residuals, upon using the altimeter data through the ESA climate change initiative (cci) sea-level (SL) project, we show here that the recently reprocessed ESA SL_cci altimeter data set (SL1) has been improved relative to the earlier AVISO altimetry data set and is now more consistent with the GECCO2 estimate and with the information about the changing ocean state embedded in other ocean data sets. The improvement can be shown to exist separately for both TOPEX/POSEIDON and ERS data sets. The study reveals that especially in regions characterized by small sea surface height (SSH) variability and small signal-to-noise ratio in the SSH data, improvements can be on the order of 30% of previously existing model–data residuals. However, in some regions we can find degradations, particulary in those where GECCO2 has little skill in representing the altimeter data and where evaluation of the products with GECCO2 is thus not advisable. Upon the assimilation of the new SL1 data set, the GECCO2 synthesis was further improved. However, adding the sea surface temperature (SST) from the SST_cci project as additional constrain, no further impact can be identified.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schodlok, M P</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Rignot, E J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ice shelf basal melt rates around Antarctica from simulations and observations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>1085-1109</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>0728 Ice shelves</keyword><keyword>4219 Continental shelf and slope processes</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>Antarctica</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>ice shelf basal melt</keyword><keyword>ice shelf ocean interaction</keyword><keyword>numerical modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JC011117</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schodlok, M.

Two simulations are carried out: the first is based on the original ECCO2 vertical discretization; the second has higher vertical resolution particularly at the depth range of ice shelf cavities. The original ECCO2 vertical discretization produces higher than observed melt rates and leads to a misrepresentation of Southern Ocean water mass properties and transports. In general, thicker levels at the base of the ice shelves lead to increased melting because of their larger heat capacity. This strengthens horizontal gradients and circulation within and outside the cavities and, in turn, warm water transports from the shelf break to the ice shelves. The simulation with more vertical levels produces basal melt rates (1735 ± 164 Gt/a) and patterns that are in better agreement with observations. Thinner levels in the sub-ice-shelf cavities improve the representation of a fresh/cold layer at the ice shelf base and of warm/salty water near the bottom, leading to a sharper pycnocline and reduced vertical mixing underneath the ice shelf. Improved water column properties lead to more accurate melt rates and patterns, especially for melt/freeze patterns under large cold-water ice shelves. At the 18 km grid spacing of the ECCO2 model configuration, the smaller, warm-water ice shelves cannot be properly represented, with higher than observed melt rates in both simulations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Song, Hajoon</author><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Follows, Michael J</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Forget, Gaël</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Source waters for the highly productive Patagonian shelf in the southwestern Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Marine Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Marine Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>120-128</pages><volume>158</volume><keywords><keyword>Adjoint sensitivity analysis</keyword><keyword>Nutrient sources</keyword><keyword>Patagonian shelf</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>Vertical mixing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jmarsys.2016.02.009</electronic-resource-num><notes>Song, H., J.

Using a passive tracer adjoint sensitivity experiment, we identify three source waters: waters local to the Patagonian shelf, coastal waters near the Chilean coast and the subsurface waters in the southeast Pacific. We perform a series of forward simulations of a biogeochemical model to investigate the impact of nutrient perturbations in these source regions to productivity on the Patagonian shelf. Positive nitrate perturbations from local waters have an immediate impact elevating productivity. Iron perturbations local to the shelf, however, do not change productivity because the shelf region is limited by nitrate. Additional nutrient supply from the other source regions leads to increases in productivity. We find that positive nutrient perturbations in subsurface waters in the southeast Pacific result in the largest boost of productivity over the shelf. These source waters are rich in nutrients and upwelled from the depth where light levels are so low that they cannot be consumed. Finally, we identify wintertime intense vertical mixing as the key process which draws nutrients from below 300–500 m to the surface before being delivered to the shelf.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spreen, G</author><author>Kwok, R</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Nguyen, A T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sea Ice Deformation in a Coupled Ocean-Sea Ice Model and in Satellite Remote Sensing Data</title><secondary-title>The Cryosphere Discuss.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cryosphere Discuss.</full-title></periodical><pages>1-37</pages><volume>2016</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/tc-2016-13</electronic-resource-num><notes>Spreen, G., R.

Its applications are manifold, ranging from marine and ecosystem forecasting to climate prediction and studies of the carbon cycle. Here, we address only climate applications, which range from improving our understanding of ocean circulation to estimating initial or boundary conditions and model parameters for ocean and climate forecasts. Because of differences in underlying methodologies, data assimilation products must be used judiciously and selected according to the specific purpose, as not all related inferences would be equally reliable. Further advances are expected from improved models and methods for estimating and representing error information in data assimilation systems. Ultimately, data assimilation into coupled climate system components is needed to support ocean and climate services. However, maintaining the infrastructure and expertise for sustained data assimilation remains challenging.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tagliabue, A</author><author>Aumont, O</author><author>DeAth, R</author><author>Dunne, J P</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Galbraith, E</author><author>Misumi, K</author><author>Moore, J K</author><author>Ridgwell, A</author><author>Sherman, E</author><author>Stock, C</author><author>Vichi, M</author><author>Volker, C</author><author>Yool, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How well do global ocean biogeochemistry models simulate dissolved iron distributions?</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>149-174</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric co2</keyword><keyword>biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>dust deposition</keyword><keyword>ecosystem model</keyword><keyword>iron</keyword><keyword>marine-phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>natural fertilization</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic ocean</keyword><keyword>nutrient-limitation</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>particle concentration</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword><keyword>world ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015gb005289</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tagliabue, A., et al.

In large areas of the ocean, iron availability regulates the functioning of marine ecosystems and hence the ocean carbon cycle. Accordingly, our ability to quantify the drivers and impacts of fluctuations in ocean ecosystems and carbon cycling in space and time relies on first achieving an appropriate representation of the modern marine iron cycle in models. When the iron distributions from 13 global ocean biogeochemistry models are compared against the latest oceanic sections from the GEOTRACES program, we find that all models struggle to reproduce many aspects of the observed spatial patterns. Models that reflect the emerging evidence for multiple iron sources or subtleties of its internal cycling perform much better in capturing observed features than their simpler contemporaries, particularly in the ocean interior. We show that the substantial uncertainty in the input fluxes of iron results in a very wide range of residence times across models, which has implications for the response of ecosystems and global carbon cycling to perturbations. Given this large uncertainty, iron fertilization experiments based on any single current generation model should be interpreted with caution. Improvements to how such models represent iron scavenging and also biological cycling are needed to raise confidence in their projections of global biogeochemical change in the ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thompson, P R</author><author>Piecuch, C G</author><author>Merrifield, M A</author><author>McCreary, J P</author><author>Firing, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forcing of recent decadal variability in the Equatorial and North Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>6762-6778</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4513 Decadal ocean variability</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>ECCOv4</keyword><keyword>Indian Ocean</keyword><keyword>decadal variability</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>sea surface height</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012132</electronic-resource-num><notes>Thompson, P.

Analysis of ocean and forcing fields from a data-assimilating ocean synthesis (ECCOv4) suggests that two equally important mechanisms of wind-driven heat redistribution within the Indian Ocean account for a majority of the decadal variability. The first is the Cross-Equatorial Cell (CEC) forced by zonal wind stress curl at the equator. The wind stress curl variability relates to the strength and position of the Mascarene High, which is influenced by the phase of the Indian Ocean Subtropical Dipole. The second mechanism is deep (700 m) upwelling related to zonal wind stress at the equator that causes deep, cross-equatorial overturning due to the unique geometry of the basin. The CEC acts to cool the upper ocean throughout most of the first decade of satellite altimetry, while the deep upwelling delays and then amplifies the effect of the CEC on SSH. During the subsequent decade, reversals in the forcing anomalies drive warming of the upper ocean and increasing SSH, with the effect of the deep upwelling leading the CEC.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Ocean Integrals and Means, with Trend Implications</title><secondary-title>Ann Rev Mar Sci</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ann Rev Mar Sci</full-title></periodical><pages>1-33</pages><volume>8</volume><edition>2015/09/04</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26331897</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-marine-122414-034040</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, Carl Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.

Attempts to determine means, integrals, and climatologies have been hindered by thinly and poorly distributed historical observations in a system in which both signals and background noise are spatially very inhomogeneous, leading to potentially large temporal bias errors that must be corrected at the 1% level or better. With the exception of the upper ocean in the current altimetric-Argo era, no clear documentation exists on the best methods for estimating means and their changes for quantities such as heat and freshwater at the levels required for anthropogenic signals. Underestimates of trends are as likely as overestimates; for example, recent inferences that multidecadal oceanic heat uptake has been greatly underestimated are plausible. For new or augmented observing systems, calculating the accuracies and precisions of global, multidecadal sampling densities for the full water column is necessary to avoid the irrecoverable loss of scientifically essential information.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Xinfeng</author><author>Yu, Lisan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variations of the Global Net Air–Sea Heat Flux during the “Hiatus” Period (2001–10)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3647-3660</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0626.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liang, X., and L.

For the 10-yr “hiatus” period, all products agree on an overall net heat gain over the global ice-free ocean, but the magnitude varies from 1.7 to 9.5 W m−2. The differences among products are particularly large in the Southern Ocean, where they cannot even agree on whether the region gains or loses heat on the annual mean basis. Decadal trends of Qnet differ significantly between products. ECCO and OAFlux–CERES show almost no trend, whereas ERA-Interim suggests a downward trend and NCEP1 shows an upward trend. Therefore, numerical simulations utilizing different surface flux forcing products will likely produce diverged trends of the ocean heat content during this period. The downward trend in ERA-Interim started from 2006, driven by a peculiar pattern change in the tropical regions....</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cole, Sylvia T.</author><author>Wortham, Cimarron</author><author>Kunze, Eric</author><author>Owens, W.

Salinity anomalies on density surfaces from Argo float profiles are used to investigate horizontal stirring and estimate eddy mixing lengths. Eddy mixing length and velocity fluctuations from the ECCO2 global state estimate are used to estimate horizontal diffusivity at a 300?km scale in the upper 2000?m with near-global coverage. Diffusivity varies by over two orders of magnitude with latitude, longitude, and depth. In all basins, diffusivity is elevated in zonal bands corresponding to strong current regions, including western boundary current extension regions, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and equatorial current systems. The estimated mixing lengths and diffusivities provide an observationally based data set that can be used to test and constrain predictions and parameterizations of eddy stirring.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balmaseda, M A</author><author>Hernandez, F</author><author>Storto, A</author><author>Palmer, M D</author><author>Alves, O</author><author>Shi, L</author><author>Smith, G C</author><author>Toyoda, T</author><author>Valdivieso, M</author><author>Barnier, B</author><author>Behringer, D</author><author>Boyer, T</author><author>Chang, Y S</author><author>Chepurin, G A</author><author>Ferry, N</author><author>Forget, G</author><author>Fujii, Y</author><author>Good, S</author><author>Guinehut, S</author><author>Haines, K</author><author>Ishikawa, Y</author><author>Keeley, S</author><author>Köhl, A</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Martin, M J</author><author>Masina, S</author><author>Masuda, S</author><author>Meyssignac, B</author><author>Mogensen, K</author><author>Parent, L</author><author>Peterson, K A</author><author>Tang, Y M</author><author>Yin, Y</author><author>Vernieres, G</author><author>Wang, X</author><author>Waters, J</author><author>Wedd, R</author><author>Wang, O</author><author>Xue, Y</author><author>Chevallier, M</author><author>Lemieux, J F</author><author>Dupont, F</author><author>Kuragano, T</author><author>Kamachi, M</author><author>Awaji, T</author><author>Caltabiano, A</author><author>Wilmer-Becker, K</author><author>Gaillard, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Ocean Reanalyses Intercomparison Project (ORA-IP)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Operational Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Operational Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>s80-s97</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>sup1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/1755876X.2015.1022329</electronic-resource-num><notes>Balmaseda, M.

For the oceanic part of this project, we introduce ECCO2-Darwin, a new ocean biogeochemistry general circulation model based on combining the following pre-existing components: (i) a full-depth, eddying, global-ocean configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm), (ii) an adjoint-method-based estimate of ocean circulation from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2) project, (iii) the MIT ecosystem model “Darwin”, and (iv) a marine carbon chemistry model. Air–sea gas exchange coefficients and initial conditions of dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, and oxygen are adjusted using a Green’s Functions approach in order to optimize modeled air–sea CO2 fluxes. Data constraints include observations of carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) for 2009–2010, global air–sea CO2 flux estimates, and the seasonal cycle of the Takahashi et al. (2009) Atlas. The model sensitivity experiments (or Green’s Functions) include simulations that start from different initial conditions as well as experiments that perturb air–sea gas exchange parameters and the ratio of particulate inorganic to organic carbon. The Green’s Functions approach yields a linear combination of these sensitivity experiments that minimizes model-data differences. The resulting initial conditions and gas exchange coefficients are then used to integrate the ECCO2-Darwin model forward. Despite the small number (six) of control parameters, the adjusted simulation is significantly closer to the data constraints (37% cost function reduction, i.e., reduction in the model-data difference, relative to the baseline simulation) and to independent observations (e.g., alkalinity). The adjusted air–sea gas exchange parameter differs by only 3% from the baseline value and has little impact ( − 0.1 %) on the cost function. The particulate inorganic to organic carbon ratio was increased more than threefold and reduced the cost function by 22% relative to the baseline integration, indicating a significant influence of biology on air–sea gas exchange. The largest contribution to cost reduction (35%) comes from the adjustment of initial conditions. In addition to reducing biases relative to observations, the adjusted simulation exhibits smaller model drift than the baseline. We estimate drift by integrating the model with repeated 2009 atmospheric forcing for seven years and find a volume-weighted drift reduction of, for example, 12.5% for nitrate and 30% for oxygen in the top 300 m. Although there remain several regions with large model-data discrepancies, for example, overly strong carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean, the adjusted simulation is a first step towards a more accurate representation of the ocean carbon cycle at high spatial and temporal resolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buckley, Martha W</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determining the origins of advective heat transport convergence variability in the North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3943-3956</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Ekman pumping/transport</keyword><keyword>Forcing</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>Rossby waves</keyword><keyword>Sea surface temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00579.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Buckley, M.

Anomalies in (linear) advective heat transport convergences, as well as Ekman and geostrophic contributions, are decomposed into parts that are due to velocity variability, temperature variability, and their covariability. Ekman convergences are generally dominated by variability in Ekman mass transports, which reflect the instantaneous response to local wind forcing, except in the tropics, where variability in the temperature field plays a significant role. In contrast, both budget analyses and simple dynamical arguments demonstrate that geostrophic heat transport convergences that are due to temperature and velocity variability are anticorrelated, and thus their separate treatment is not insightful. In the interior of the subtropical gyre, the sum of air–sea heat fluxes and Ekman heat transport convergences is a reasonable measure of local atmospheric forcing, and such forcing explains the majority of H variability on all time scales resolved by ECCO. In contrast, in the Gulf Stream region and subpolar gyre, ocean dynamics are found to be important in setting H on interannual time scales. Air–sea heat fluxes damp anomalies created by the ocean and thus are not set by local atmospheric variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Ru</author><author>Flierl, Glenn R</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying and interpreting striations in a subtropical gyre: A spectral perspective</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>387-406</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Circulation/ Dynamics,Stationary waves,Atm/Ocean S</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-14-0038.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chen, R., G.

Striations, defined as banded structures in the low-frequency motions, account for a noticeable percentage of zonal velocity variability in the east North Pacific (ENP: 25°–42°N, 150°–130°W) and central North Pacific (CNP: 10°–22°N, 132°E–162°W) regions in an eddying global ocean model. Thus, they likely are nonnegligible in mixing and transport processes. Striations in the ENP region are nonzonal and are embedded in the nonzonal gyre flow, whereas striations in the CNP region are more zonal, as are the mean gyre flows. An idealized 1.5-layer model shows the gyre flow partially determines their directions, which qualitatively resemble those in the global eddying model. In the linear limit, structures are quasi-stationary (frequency ω → 0) linear Rossby waves and the gyre flow influences the direction by influencing the nature of the zero Rossby wave frequency curve. In the nonlinear regime, striations are consistent with the nondispersively propagating eddies, whose low-frequency component has banded structures. The gyre flow influences the striation direction by changing the eddy propagation direction. Their origin in the nonlinear regime is consistent with the existence of a nondispersive line in the frequency–wavenumber spectra. This study does not exclude other striation mechanisms from literature, considering that the interpretations here are based on an idealized model and only from a spectral perspective.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Duarte, Pedro</author><author>Assmy, Philipp</author><author>Hop, Haakon</author><author>Spreen, Gunnar</author><author>Gerland, Sebastian</author><author>Hudson, Stephen R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The importance of vertical resolution in sea ice algae production models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Marine Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Marine Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>69-90</pages><volume>145</volume><keywords><keyword>Abiotic factors</keyword><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>Ice algae</keyword><keyword>Limiting factors</keyword><keyword>Marine ecology</keyword><keyword>Modeling</keyword><keyword>Sea ice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jmarsys.2014.12.004</electronic-resource-num><notes>Duarte, P., P.

Ice algae are reported to contribute 4–26% of overall Arctic Ocean primary production and are an important food source for the ice-associated ecosystem. Thus, it is important to estimate the future impacts of global warming on the contribution of ice algae to Arctic primary production. Primary production models, describing the relationships between ice-algal physiology and population dynamics, with environmental forcing and trophic interactions involving bacteria and grazers, can be applied to quantify such impacts. One important aspect in these models is how to represent the vertical distribution of ice algae in sea ice. In most models, only the bottom ice layer is considered where most of the algal biomass tends to be concentrated. However, since ice algae are also present along the entire ice column, this may lead to underestimation of ice-algal production. Some empirical data and model results suggest that ice algae located in the surface and interior layers may be kept at lower concentrations, in spite of high growth rates, due to grazing by micro- and meiofauna. Results obtained in this study show the importance of resolving vertically the distribution of ice algae to avoid bias in primary production estimates, well in line with empirical studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Hickman, A E</author><author>Jahn, O</author><author>Gregg, W W</author><author>Mouw, C B</author><author>Follows, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Capturing optically important constituents and properties in a marine biogeochemical and ecosystem model</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>4447-4481</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-12-4447-2015</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dutkiewicz, S., A.

The ASC in this region flows westward along isobaths with an annual mean speed of ∼0.2 m s−1, with time variability dominated by the K1 and O1 tidal diurnal constituents, a narrowband oscillation with ∼2-week period attributable to the spring/neap tidal cycle, and seasonal variability. Realistic and idealized high-resolution numerical simulations are used to determine the contribution of tides to the structure of the ASF and the speed of the ASC. Two simulations forced by realistic atmospheric forcing and boundary conditions integrated with and without tidal forcing show that tidal forcing is essential to reproduce the measured ASF/ASC cross-slope structure, the time variability at our moorings, and the reduced stratification within the WSC. Two idealized simulations run with tide-only forcing, one with a homogeneous ocean and the other with initial vertical stratification that is laterally homogeneous, show that tides can generate the ASC and ASF through volume flux convergence along the slope initiated by effects including the Lagrangian component of tidal rectification and mixing at the seabed and in the stratified ocean interior. Climate models that exclude the effects of tides will not correctly represent the ASF and ASC or their influence on the injection of intermediate and dense waters from the WSC to the deep ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, G</author><author>Campin, J M</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Hill, C N</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECCO version 4: an integrated framework for non-linear inverse modeling and global ocean state estimation</title><secondary-title>Geosci.

Optimal inference from the data involves appropriate partition of signal and noise, in terms of relevant scales, physical processes and forcing mechanisms. Such partition is achieved here through fitting a general circulation model to altimeter and other datasets to produce a “best” estimate of ζ variability directly forced by the atmosphere—the signal of primary interest here. In this context noise comes primarily from instrument errors and meso-scale eddies, as expected, but spatial smoothing effectively reduces this noise. A separate constraint is thus formulated to measure the fit to monthly, large-scale altimetric variability that unlike the daily, pointwise constraint shows a high signal-to-noise ratio. The estimate is explored to gain insight into dynamics, forcing, and other factors controlling ζ variability. Contributions from thermo-steric, halo-steric and bottom pressure terms are all important depending on region, but slopes of steric spectra (red) and bottom pressure spectra (white) are nearly invariant with latitude. Much ζ variability can be represented by a seasonal cycle and linear trend, plus a few EOFs that can be associated with known modes of climate variability and/or with topographic controls. Both wind and buoyancy forcing are important. The response is primarily basin-bound in nature, but uneven patterns of propagation across basin boundaries are clearly present, with the Pacific being able to affect large portions of the Indian and Atlantic basins, but the Atlantic affecting mostly the Arctic.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Blayo M.

The variation extends across the interconnected deep ocean basins of these semi-enclosed Arctic seas, collectively called the Arctic Mediterranean, with spatially near-uniform amplitude and phase. The basin-wide fluctuation is barotropic and dominates the region’s large-scale variability from sub-monthly to interannual timescales. The fluctuation results from bifurcating coastally trapped waves generated by winds along the continental slopes of the Arctic Mediterranean and its neighboring seas, including the North Atlantic Ocean. The winds drive Ekman transport across the large bathymetric gradients, forcing mass divergence between the shallow coastal area and the deep ocean basins and creating ocean bottom pressure anomalies of opposite signs in the two regions. The anomalies rapidly propagate away as barotropic coastally trapped waves with the coast and continental slope as respective boundaries. The waves subsequently bifurcate at the shallow straits connecting the Arctic Mediterranean with the rest of the globe. The straits transmit the shallow anomalies but not the deep variations, thereby inhibiting the anomalies’ mutual cancelation by geographically separating the two. Anomalies that enter the deep Arctic basins equilibrate uniformly across the domain characterized by a homogeneous depth-integrated planetary potential vorticity distribution. The potential vorticity’s steep gradient that borders the basins shields the region from neighboring shallow variations, giving rise to the observed spatially confined fluctuation. Compensating anomalies outside the Arctic adjust similarly across the rest of the globe but are comparatively negligible in amplitude because of the global ocean’s larger area relative to that of the deep Arctic Mediterranean. The study, from a technical perspective, illustrates the utility of a model’s adjoint in identifying causal mechanisms underlying a complex system.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halkides, D J</author><author>Waliser, Duane E</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Guan, Bin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying the processes controlling intraseasonal mixed-layer temperature variability in the tropical Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>692-715</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>4223 Descriptive and regional oceanography</keyword><keyword>4231 Equatorial oceanography</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>Indian Ocean</keyword><keyword>MJO</keyword><keyword>intraseasonal</keyword><keyword>mixed-layer</keyword><keyword>temperature budget</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014JC010139</electronic-resource-num><notes>Halkides, D.

We introduce a new metric for representing spatial variability of the relative importance of processes. In general, horizontal advection is most important at the Equator. Subsurface processes and surface heat flux are more important away from the Equator, with surface heat flux being the more dominant factor. Analyses at key sites are discussed in the context of local dynamics and literature. At 0°, 80.5°E, for MLT events &gt; 2 standard deviations, ocean dynamics account for more than two thirds of the net tendency during cooling and warming phases. Zonal advection alone accounts for ∼40% of the net tendency. Moderate events (1–2 standard deviations) show more differences between events, and some are dominated by surface heat flux. At 8°S, 67°E in the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge (SCTR) area, surface heat flux accounts for ∼70% of the tendency during strong cooling and warming phases; subsurface processes linked to ML depth (MLD) deepening (shoaling) during cooling (warming) account for ∼30%. MLT is more sensitive to subsurface processes in the SCTR, due to the thin MLD, thin barrier layer and raised thermocline. Results for 8°S, 67°E support assertions by Vialard et al. (2008) not previously confirmed due to measurement error that prevented budget closure and the small number of events studied. The roles of MLD, barrier layer thickness, and thermocline depth on different timescales are examined.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halpern, David</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Wang, Xiaochun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of Data Assimilation on ECCO2 Equatorial Undercurrent and North Equatorial Countercurrent in the Pacific Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>131-143</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Pacific Ocean,Ocean circulation,Atmosphere-ocean i</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JTECH-D-14-00025.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Halpern, D., D.

Two Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2), solutions were analyzed: one with data assimilation and one without. Assimilated data included satellite observations of sea surface temperature and ocean surface topography, in which the sampling patterns were approximately uniform over the 5 years, and in situ measurements of subsurface salinity and temperature profiles, in which the sampling patterns varied considerably in space and time throughout the 5 years. Velocity measurements were not assimilated. The impact of data assimilation was considered significant when the difference between the transports computed with and without data assimilation was greater than 5.5 × 106 m3 s−1 (or 5.5 Sv; 1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1) for the EUC and greater than 5.0 Sv for the NECC. In addition, the difference of annual-mean transports computed from 3-day-averaged data was statistically significant at the 95% level. The impact of data assimilation ranged from no impact to very substantial impact when data assimilation increased the EUC transport and decreased the NECC transport. The study’s EUC results had some correspondence with other studies and no simple agreement or disagreement pattern emerged among all studies of the impact of data assimilation. No comparable study of the impact of data assimilation on the NECC has been made.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Le Fouest, V</author><author>Manizza, M</author><author>Tremblay, B</author><author>Babin, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling the impact of riverine DON removal by marine bacterioplankton on primary production in the Arctic Ocean</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>3385-3402</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-12-3385-2015</electronic-resource-num><notes>Le Fouest, V., M.

Using a dynamically consistent state estimate, the redistribution of heat within the ocean is calculated over a 20-yr period. The 20-yr mean vertical heat flux shows strong variations in both the lateral and vertical directions, consistent with the ocean being a dynamically active and spatially complex heat exchanger. Between mixing and advection, the two processes determining the vertical heat transport in the deep ocean, advection plays a more important role in setting the spatial patterns of vertical heat exchange and its temporal variations. The global integral of vertical heat flux shows an upward heat transport in the deep ocean, suggesting a cooling trend in the deep ocean. These results support an inference that the near-surface thermal properties of the ocean are a consequence, at least in part, of internal redistributions of heat, some of which must reflect water that has undergone long trajectories since last exposure to the atmosphere. The small residual heat exchange with the atmosphere today is unlikely to represent the interaction with an ocean that was in thermal equilibrium at the start of global warming. An analogy is drawn with carbon-14 “reservoir ages,” which range from over hundreds to a thousand years.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCaffrey, Katherine</author><author>Fox-Kemper, Baylor</author><author>Forget, Gael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimates of ocean macroturbulence: Structure function and spectral slope from Argo profiling floats</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1773-1793</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-14-0023.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>McCaffrey, K., B.

This study uses Argo temperature and salinity data to form the tracer structure function of ocean variability at the macroscale (10–1000 km, mesoscale and above). Here, second-order temperature and salinity structure functions over horizontal separations are calculated along either pressure or potential density surfaces, which allows analysis of both active and passive tracer structure functions. Using Argo data, a map of global variance is created from the climatological average and each datum. When turbulence is homogeneous, the structure function slope from Argo can be related to the wavenumber spectrum slope in ocean temperature or salinity variability. This first application of structure function techniques to Argo data gives physically meaningful results based on bootstrapped confidence intervals, showing geographical dependence of the structure functions with slopes near ⅔ on average, independent of depth.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ott, Lesley E</author><author>Pawson, Steven</author><author>Collatz, George J</author><author>Gregg, Watson W</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Brix, Holger</author><author>Rousseaux, Cecile S</author><author>Bowman, Kevin W</author><author>Liu, Junjie</author><author>Eldering, Annmarie</author><author>Gunson, Michael R</author><author>Kawa, Stephan R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the magnitude of CO2 flux uncertainty in atmospheric CO2 records using products from NASA's Carbon Monitoring Flux Pilot Project</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</full-title></periodical><pages>734-765</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>0312 Air/sea constituent fluxes</keyword><keyword>0315 Biosphere/atmosphere interactions</keyword><keyword>0322 Constituent sources and sinks</keyword><keyword>CMS</keyword><keyword>CO2</keyword><keyword>GOSAT</keyword><keyword>biosphere</keyword><keyword>modeling</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014JD022411</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ott, L.

Here we report on simulations using NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS-5) which was used to evaluate the consistency of two different sets of observationally informed land and ocean fluxes with atmospheric CO2 records. Despite the observation inputs, the average difference in annual terrestrial biosphere flux between the two land (NASA Ames Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) and CASA-Global Fire Emissions Database version 3 (GFED)) models is 1.7 Pg C for 2009–2010. Ocean models (NASA's Ocean Biogeochemical Model (NOBM) and Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Phase II (ECCO2)-Darwin) differ by 35% in their global estimates of carbon flux with particularly strong disagreement in high latitudes. Based upon combinations of terrestrial and ocean fluxes, GEOS-5 reasonably simulated the seasonal cycle observed at Northern Hemisphere surface sites and by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) while the model struggled to simulate the seasonal cycle at Southern Hemisphere surface locations. Though GEOS-5 was able to reasonably reproduce the patterns of XCO2 observed by GOSAT, it struggled to reproduce these aspects of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder observations. Despite large differences between land and ocean flux estimates, resulting differences in atmospheric mixing ratio were small, typically less than 5 ppm at the surface and 3 ppm in the XCO2 column. A statistical analysis based on the variability of observations shows that flux differences of these magnitudes are difficult to distinguish from inherent measurement variability, regardless of the measurement platform.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, C G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bottom-pressure signature of annual baroclinic Rossby waves in the northeast tropical Pacific Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>2449-2459</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>annual cycle</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>currents</keyword><keyword>eddies</keyword><keyword>ocean mass</keyword><keyword>tropical Pacific</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014jc010667</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

Monthly gridded estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Release-05 and the new version 4 bidecadal ocean state estimate of the Consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) are used. Estimates of from GRACE and ECCO are generally in good agreement, providing an independent measure of the quality of both products. Diagnostic fields from the state estimate are used to compute barotropic (depth independent) and baroclinic (depth dependent) components. The relative roles of baroclinic and barotropic processes are found to vary with latitude and time scale: variations in at higher latitudes and shorter periods are affected by barotropic processes, whereas fluctuations at lower latitudes and longer periods can be influenced by baroclinic effects, broadly consistent with theoretical scaling arguments. Wind-driven Rossby waves and coupling of baroclinic and barotropic modes due to flow?topography interactions appear to be important influences on the baroclinic variability. Decadal simulations of monthly variability based on purely barotropic frameworks are expected to be in error by about 30% on average ( in the tropical ocean and at higher latitudes). Results have implications for applying GRACE observations to problems such as estimating transports of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Forget, Gaël</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sensitivity of contemporary sea level trends in a global ocean state estimate to effects of geothermal fluxes</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>214-220</pages><volume>96, Part 2</volume><keywords><keyword>Geothermal fluxes</keyword><keyword>Ocean general circulation model</keyword><keyword>Ocean state estimation</keyword><keyword>Passive tracer</keyword><keyword>Sea level rise</keyword><keyword>Solid Earth surface heat flow</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2015.10.008</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

Model simulations of contemporary sea level that impose a geothermal flux boundary condition are becoming increasingly common. To quantify the impact of geothermal fluxes on model estimates of contemporary (1993–2010) sea level changes, two ocean circulation model experiments are compared. The two simulations are based on a global ocean state estimate, produced by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium, and differ only with regard to whether geothermal forcing is applied as a boundary condition. Geothermal forcing raises the global-mean sea level trend by 0.11 mm yr − 1 in the perturbation experiment by suppressing a cooling trend present in the baseline solution below 2000 m. The imposed forcing also affects regional sea level trends. The Southern Ocean is particularly sensitive. In this region, anomalous heat redistribution due to geothermal fluxes results in steric height trends of up to ± 1 mm yr − 1 in the perturbation experiment relative to the baseline simulation. Analysis of a passive tracer experiment suggests that the geothermal input itself is transported by horizontal diffusion, resulting in more thermal expansion over deeper ocean basins. Thermal expansion in the perturbation simulation gives rise to bottom pressure increase over shallower regions and decrease over deeper areas relative to the baseline run, consistent with mass redistribution expected for deep ocean warming. These results elucidate the influence of geothermal fluxes on sea level rise and global heat budgets in model simulations of contemporary ocean circulation and climate.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Quinn, Katherine J</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Tamisiea, Mark E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of self-attraction and loading on Earth rotation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>4510-4521</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>1218 Mass balance</keyword><keyword>1223 Ocean/Earth/atmosphere/hydrosphere/cryosphere</keyword><keyword>1239 Earth rotation variations</keyword><keyword>Earth rotation</keyword><keyword>length of day</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>self-attraction and loading</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JB011980</electronic-resource-num><notes>Quinn, K.

We estimate Earth rotation excitations using models of atmospheric, oceanic, and land hydrology surface mass variations and investigate the importance of including SAL over monthly to interannual timescales. We assess SAL effects in comparison with simple mass balance effects where net mass exchanged with the atmosphere and land is distributed uniformly over the global ocean. For oceanic polar motion excitations, SAL impacts are important even though mass balance impact is minor except at the annual period. This is true of global (atmosphere + land + ocean) polar motion excitations as well, although the SAL impacts are smaller. When estimating length-of-day excitations, mass balance effects have a dominant impact, particularly for oceanic excitation. Although SAL can have a significant impact on estimated Earth rotation excitations, its consideration generally did not improve comparisons with geodetic observations. This result may change in the future as surface mass models and Earth rotation observations improve.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van der Stocken, Tom</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biological and environmental drivers of mangrove propagule dispersal: a field and modeling approach</title></titles><periodical/><volume>Ph.D.</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Universite Libre de Bruxelles</publisher><notes>Van der Stocken, T., 2015: Biological and environmental drivers of mangrove propagule dispersal: a field and modeling approach.

Their influence on global ocean circulation is well known, but their role in plankton transport is largely unexplored. We show that, although the coarse taxonomic structure of plankton communities is continuous across the Agulhas choke point, South Atlantic plankton diversity is altered compared with Indian Ocean source populations. Modeling and in situ sampling of a young Agulhas ring indicate that strong vertical mixing drives complex nitrogen cycling, shaping community metabolism and biogeochemical signatures as the ring and associated plankton transit westward. The peculiar local environment inside Agulhas rings may provide a selective mechanism contributing to the limited dispersal of Indian Ocean plankton populations into the Atlantic.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, Nadya T</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Quinn, Katherine J</author><author>Tamisiea, Mark E</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Davis, James L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic Adjustment of the Ocean Circulation to Self-Attraction and Loading Effects</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>678-689</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-14-0150.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vinogradova, N.

In particular, so-called self-attraction and loading (SAL) effects caused by the redistribution of mass within the land?atmosphere?ocean system can have a measurable impact on sea level. In this study, the nature of SAL-induced variability in sea level is examined in terms of its equilibrium (static) and nonequilibrium (dynamic) components, using a general circulation model that implicitly includes the physics of SAL. The additional SAL forcing is derived by decomposing ocean mass anomalies into spherical harmonics and then applying Love numbers to infer associated crustal displacements and gravitational shifts. This implementation of SAL physics incurs only a relatively small computational cost. Effects of SAL on sea level amount to about 10% of the applied surface loading on average but depend strongly on location. The dynamic component exhibits large-scale basinwide patterns, with considerable contributions from subweekly time scales. Departures from equilibrium decrease toward longer time scales but are not totally negligible in many places. Ocean modeling studies should benefit from using a dynamical implementation of SAL as used here.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Xiaochun</author><author>Zhao, Liqing</author><author>Li, Zhijin</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regional ocean forecasting systems and their applications: Design considerations of such a system for the South China Sea</title><secondary-title>Aquatic Ecosystem Health &amp; Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aquatic Ecosystem Health &amp; Management</full-title></periodical><pages>443-453</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14634988.2015.1112123</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wang, X., L.

We introduce a new climatological data set of river discharge and river water temperature with 1/6° grid spacing over the Arctic region (Arctic River Discharge and Temperature; ARDAT), incorporating observations from 30 Arctic rivers. The annual mean discharge for all rivers in ARDAT is 2817 ± 330 km3 yr−1. River water temperatures range between 0 °C in winter to 14.0–17.6 °C in July, leading to a long-term mean monthly heat flux from all rivers of 3.2 ± 0.6 TW, of which 31% is supplied by Alaskan rivers and 69% is supplied by Eurasian rivers. This riverine heat flux is equivalent to 44% of the estimated ocean heat flux associated with the Bering Strait throughflow, but during the spring freshet can be ∼10 times as large, suggesting that heat flux associated with Arctic rivers is an important component of the Arctic heat budget on seasonal time scales. We apply the ARDAT data set to a high-resolution regional ocean-ice model, and compare results to a model integration using a 1° resolution discharge data set. Integrated freshwater content on the Arctic shelves (&amp;lt;200 m) increases by ∼3600 km3 in the ARDAT forced model run compared to the coarser forcing, suggesting that river discharge is contained on the Arctic shelves when forced with the ARDAT data set. Modelled summer heat fluxes over the shelves increase by 8 TW when river water temperature is included, which subsequently reduces basin-wide September sea ice extent by ∼10%. Regional differences are larger, where e.g., sea ice extent on the Beaufort shelf is reduced by ∼36%. Using a non-linear free surface parameterization along with the ARDAT data set, we find an increase in the sea surface height gradient around river mouths. Geostrophic velocities increase to form quasi-continuous, fast-moving near-shore boundary currents not reproduced using the 1° resolution data set. Omitting river water temperature, or using a lower resolution data set, can therefore lead to incorrect model estimates of coastal transport, sea ice formation/melt rates, and other regional and basin scale processes. Using a high-resolution discharge data set, and accounting for the considerable heat carried by the Arctic rivers is recommended for future modelling efforts.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yan, C X</author><author>Zhu, J</author><author>Xie, J P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An ocean data assimilation system in the Indian Ocean and west Pacific Ocean</title><secondary-title>Advances in Atmospheric Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Atmospheric Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1460-1472</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>air-sea interaction</keyword><keyword>background error covariance</keyword><keyword>china</keyword><keyword>climate system</keyword><keyword>doppler</keyword><keyword>eddy</keyword><keyword>ensemble optimal interpolation</keyword><keyword>indonesian throughflow</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean data assimilation</keyword><keyword>part ii</keyword><keyword>prediction</keyword><keyword>radar</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00376-015-4121-z</electronic-resource-num><notes>Yan, C.

The ocean data assimilation system in the regions including the Indian and West Pacific oceans is an endeavor motivated by this goal. In this study, we describe the system in detail. Moreover, the reanalysis in the joint area of Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean (hereafter AIPOcean) constructed using multi-year model integration with data assimilation is used to test the performance of this system. The ocean model is an eddy-resolving, hybrid coordinate ocean model. Various types of observations including in-situ temperature and salinity profiles (mechanical bathythermograph, expendable bathythermograph, Array for Real-time Geostrophic Oceanography, Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Array, conductivity-temperature-depth, station data), remotely-sensed sea surface temperature, and altimetry sea level anomalies, are assimilated into the reanalysis via the ensemble optimal interpolation method. An ensemble of model states sampled from a long-term integration is allowed to change with season, rather than remaining stationary. The estimated background error covariance matrix may reasonably reflect the seasonality and anisotropy. We evaluate the performance of AIPOcean during the period 1993-2006 by comparisons with independent observations, and some reanalysis products. We show that AIPOcean reduces the errors of subsurface temperature and salinity, and reproduces mesoscale eddies. In contrast to ECCO and SODA products, AIPOcean captures the interannual variability and linear trend of sea level anomalies very well. AIPOcean also shows a good consistency with tide gauges.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zemskova, Varvara E</author><author>White, Brian L</author><author>Scotti, Alberto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Available Potential Energy and the General Circulation: Partitioning Wind, Buoyancy Forcing, and Diapycnal Mixing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1510-1531</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Circulation/ Dynamics,Buoyancy,Convection,Diapycna</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-14-0043.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zemskova, V.

Compared with the traditional Lorenz energy cycle, this framework provides a more accurate estimate of the background potential energy (PE) of the global oceans and the surface generation and interior fluxes of APE. Calculations of the global energy budget using 16 yr of ECCO2 output suggest that the adiabatic portion of the general circulation is maintained by a balance between the mean wind-driven upwelling that increases APE (+0.27 TW) and time-fluctuating processes, including mesoscale eddies, which release APE (−0.27 TW). The APE generated by surface buoyancy fluxes (0.46 TW) is comparable to the generation by the mean winds. The global rate of irreversible mixing (0.46 TW), which balances surface APE generation, is consistent with previous estimates of the diapycnal fluxes associated with maintaining deep stratification (see Munk and Wunsch) and a global diapycnal diffusivity of O(1 × 10−4) m2 s−1. However, the net contribution of diapycnal mixing to the total potential energy is negligible, which suggests that mixing, contrary to one current paradigm, does not place a global demand on kinetic energy dissipation. However, there are regions where mixing is significant, for example, between 3000 and 5000 m (in ECCO2), where mixing increases PE by 0.1 TW. The work provides a new framework for separating adiabatic–diabatic fluxes and for monitoring the global rate of diapycnal mixing rate using measurable surface properties such as SST and heat flux.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Y X</author><author>Jacob, D J</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Amos, H M</author><author>Long, M S</author><author>Sunderland, E M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biogeochemical drivers of the fate of riverine mercury discharged to the global and Arctic oceans</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>854-864</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>DARWIN project</keyword><keyword>ECCO-GODAE</keyword><keyword>Mercury</keyword><keyword>air-sea exchange</keyword><keyword>beaufort sea</keyword><keyword>continental-shelf</keyword><keyword>dissolved organic-matter</keyword><keyword>gas-exchange</keyword><keyword>mackenzie river</keyword><keyword>marginal sea</keyword><keyword>marine waters</keyword><keyword>methylated mercury</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>river</keyword><keyword>sediment accumulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015gb005124</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhang, Y.

Most of the Hg discharged by rivers is sequestered by burial of benthic sediment in estuaries or the coastal zone, but some is evaded to the atmosphere and some is exported to the open ocean. We investigate the fate of riverine Hg by developing a new global 3-D simulation for Hg in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ocean general circulation model. The model includes plankton dynamics and carbon respiration (DARWIN project model) coupled to inorganic Hg chemistry. Results are consistent with observed spatial patterns and magnitudes of surface ocean Hg concentrations. We use observational constraints on seawater Hg concentrations and evasion to infer that most Hg from rivers is sorbed to refractory organic carbon and preferentially buried. Only 6% of Hg discharged by rivers (1.8Mmolyr(-1)) is transported to the open ocean on a global basis. This fraction varies from a low of 2.6% in East Asia due to the barrier imposed by the Korean Peninsula and Japanese archipelago, up to 25% in eastern North America facilitated by the Gulf Stream. In the Arctic Ocean, low tributary particle loads and efficient degradation of particulate organic carbon by deltaic microbial communities favor a more labile riverine Hg pool. Evasion of Hg to the Arctic atmosphere is indirectly enhanced by heat transport during spring freshet that accelerates sea ice melt and ice rafting. Discharges of 0.23MmolHgyr(-1) from Arctic rivers can explain the observed summer maximum in the Arctic atmosphere, and this magnitude of releases is consistent with recent observations. Our work indicates that rivers are major contributors to Hg loads in the Arctic Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Junjie</author><author>Bowman, Kevin W</author><author>Lee, Meemong</author><author>Henze, Daven K</author><author>Bousserez, Nicolas</author><author>Brix, Holger</author><author>James Collatz, G</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Ott, Lesley</author><author>Pawson, Steven</author><author>Jones, Dylan</author><author>Nassar, Ray</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carbon monitoring system flux estimation and attribution: impact of ACOS-GOSAT XCO2 sampling on the inference of terrestrial biospheric sources and sinks</title><secondary-title>Tellus B: Chemical and Physical Meteorology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tellus B: Chemical and Physical Meteorology</full-title></periodical><pages>22486</pages><volume>66</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3402/tellusb.v66.22486</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liu, J., and Coauthors, 2014: Carbon monitoring system flux estimation and attribution: impact of ACOS-GOSAT XCO2 sampling on the inference of terrestrial biospheric sources and sinks.

(GOSAT) sampling on the estimation of terrestrial biospheric flux with the NASA Carbon Monitoring System Flux (CMS-Flux) estimation and attribution strategy. The simulated observations in the OSSE use the actual column carbon dioxide (XCO2 ) b2.9 retrieval sensitivity and quality control for the year 2010 processed through the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space algorithm. CMS-Flux is a variational inversion system that uses the GEOS-Chem forward and adjoint model forced by a suite of observationally constrained fluxes from ocean, land and anthropogenic models. We investigate the impact of GOSAT sampling on flux estimation in two aspects: 1) random error uncertainty reduction and 2) the global and regional bias in posterior flux resulted from the spatiotemporally biased GOSAT sampling. Based on Monte Carlo calculations, we find that global average flux uncertainty reduction ranges from 25% in September to 60% in July. When aggregated to the 11 land regions designated by the phase 3 of the Atmospheric Tracer Transport Model Intercomparison Project, the annual mean uncertainty reduction ranges from 10% over North American boreal to 38% over South American temperate, which is driven by observational coverage and the magnitude of prior flux uncertainty. The uncertainty reduction over the South American tropical region is 30%, even with sparse observation coverage. We show that this reduction results from the large prior flux uncertainty and the impact of non-local observations. Given the assumed prior error statistics, the degree of freedom for signal is ~1132 for 1-yr of the 74 055 GOSAT XCO2 observations, which indicates that GOSAT provides ~1132 independent pieces of information about surface fluxes. We quantify the impact of GOSAT's spatiotemporally sampling on the posterior flux, and find that a 0.7 gigatons of carbon bias in the global annual posterior flux resulted from the seasonally and diurnally biased sampling when using a diagonal prior flux error covariance.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amos, H M</author><author>Jacob, D J</author><author>Kocman, D</author><author>Horowitz, H M</author><author>Zhang, Y X</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Horvat, M</author><author>Corbitt, E S</author><author>Krabbenhoft, D P</author><author>Sunderland, E M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Biogeochemical Implications of Mercury Discharges from Rivers and Sediment Burial</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>9514-9522</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>air-sea exchange</keyword><keyword>arctic-ocean</keyword><keyword>estuary</keyword><keyword>heavy-metals</keyword><keyword>mackenzie river</keyword><keyword>mass-balance</keyword><keyword>metal accumulation</keyword><keyword>south china</keyword><keyword>speciation</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/es502134t</electronic-resource-num><notes>Amos, H.

Globally, the source of Hg to the open ocean from rivers amounts to 30% of atmospheric inputs. This is larger than previously estimated due to accounting for elevated concentrations in Asian rivers and variability in offshore transport across different types of estuaries. Riverine inputs of Hg to the North Atlantic have decreased several-fold since the 1970s while inputs to the North Pacific have increased. These trends have large effects on Hg concentrations at ocean margins but are too small in the open ocean to explain observed declines of seawater concentrations in the North Atlantic or increases in the North Pacific. Burial of Hg in ocean margin sediments represents a major sink in the global Hg biogeochemical cycle that has not been previously considered. We find that including this sink in a fully coupled global biogeochemical box model helps to balance the large anthropogenic release of Hg from commercial products recently added to global inventories. It also implies that legacy anthropogenic Hg can be removed from active environmental cycling on a faster time scale (centuries instead of millennia). Natural environmental Hg levels are lower than previously estimated, implying a relatively larger impact from human activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Azaneu, M</author><author>Kerr, R</author><author>Mata, M M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of the representation of Antarctic Bottom Water properties in the ECCO2 reanalysis</title><secondary-title>Ocean Sci.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Sci.</full-title></periodical><pages>923-946</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/os-10-923-2014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Azaneu, M., R.

Fields from the 1) ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), 2) Common Ocean Ice Reference Experiment version 2 (CORE2), 3) Japanese 25-yr Reanalysis Project (SRA-25), 4) NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, 5) NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and 6) Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) are evaluated against satellite-derived and in situ observations for zonal and meridional winds, precipitation, specific humidity, surface air temperature, and downwelling longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes. Comparison to reference observations shows that for variables such as air temperature and humidity, all reanalysis products have similar solutions. However, other variables such as winds, precipitation, and radiation show large spreads. The magnitude of uncertainties in all fields is large when compared to the signal. Biases in Arctic cloud parameterizations and predicted temperature and humidity profiles in reanalyses as discussed in other studies are likely common sources of error that affect surface downwelling radiation, air temperature, humidity, and precipitation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Ru</author><author>Flierl, Glenn R</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Description of Local and Nonlocal Eddy–Mean Flow Interaction in a Global Eddy-Permitting State Estimate</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2336-2352</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Circulation/ Dynamics,Eddies,Energy transport,Phys</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-14-0009.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chen, R., G.

Interactions are divided into local and nonlocal. If all the energy released from the mean flow through eddy–mean flow interaction is used to support eddy growth in the same region, or if all the energy released from eddies through eddy–mean flow interaction is used to feed back to the mean flow in the same region, eddy–mean flow interaction is local; otherwise, it is nonlocal. Different regions have different characters: in the subtropical region studied in detail, interactions are dominantly local. In the Southern Ocean and Kuroshio and Gulf Stream Extension regions, they are mainly nonlocal. Geographical variability of dominant eddy–eddy and eddy–mean flow processes is a dominant factor in understanding ocean energetics.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Childers, Katelin</author><author>Flagg, Charles N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circulation and Transport Across the Iceland Faroes Shetland Ridge</title><secondary-title>Marine and Atmospheric Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine and Atmospheric Science</full-title></periodical><pages>122</pages><volume>Ph.D.</volume><issue>3684409</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>Ann Arbor</pub-location><publisher>State University of New York at Stony Brook</publisher><notes>Childers, K., and C.

Using a least squares fit of a full general circulation and sea ice model to upper-ocean proxy data with specified error estimates, a seasonally varying reconstruction is sought of the Atlantic Ocean state that is consistent with both the known dynamics and the data. With reasonable uncertainty assumptions for the observations and the adjustable (control) variables, a consistent LGM ocean state is found, one not radically different from the modern one. Inferred changes include a strengthening of the easterly and westerly winds, leading to strengthened subtropical and subpolar gyres, and increased upwelling favorable winds off the coast of Africa, leading to particularly cold SSTs in those regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danabasoglu, Gokhan</author><author>Yeager, Steve G</author><author>Bailey, David</author><author>Behrens, Erik</author><author>Bentsen, Mats</author><author>Bi, Daohua</author><author>Biastoch, Arne</author><author>Böning, Claus</author><author>Bozec, Alexandra</author><author>Canuto, Vittorio M</author><author>Cassou, Christophe</author><author>Chassignet, Eric</author><author>Coward, Andrew C</author><author>Danilov, Sergey</author><author>Diansky, Nikolay</author><author>Drange, Helge</author><author>Farneti, Riccardo</author><author>Fernandez, Elodie</author><author>Fogli, Pier Giuseppe</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Griffies, Stephen M</author><author>Gusev, Anatoly</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Howard, Armando</author><author>Jung, Thomas</author><author>Kelley, Maxwell</author><author>Large, William G</author><author>Leboissetier, Anthony</author><author>Lu, Jianhua</author><author>Madec, Gurvan</author><author>Marsland, Simon J</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Navarra, Antonio</author><author>George Nurser, A J</author><author>Pirani, Anna</author><author>y Mélia, David Salas</author><author>Samuels, Bonita L</author><author>Scheinert, Markus</author><author>Sidorenko, Dmitry</author><author>Treguier, Anne-Marie</author><author>Tsujino, Hiroyuki</author><author>Uotila, Petteri</author><author>Valcke, Sophie</author><author>Voldoire, Aurore</author><author>Wang, Qiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>North Atlantic simulations in Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments phase II (CORE-II).

These experiments use inter-annually varying atmospheric forcing data sets for the 60-year period from 1948 to 2007 and are performed as contributions to the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II). The protocol for conducting such CORE-II experiments is summarized. Despite using the same atmospheric forcing, the solutions show significant differences. As most models also differ from available observations, biases in the Labrador Sea region in upper-ocean potential temperature and salinity distributions, mixed layer depths, and sea-ice cover are identified as contributors to differences in AMOC. These differences in the solutions do not suggest an obvious grouping of the models based on their ocean model lineage, their vertical coordinate representations, or surface salinity restoring strengths. Thus, the solution differences among the models are attributed primarily to use of different subgrid scale parameterizations and parameter choices as well as to differences in vertical and horizontal grid resolutions in the ocean models. Use of a wide variety of sea-ice models with diverse snow and sea-ice albedo treatments also contributes to these differences. Based on the diagnostics considered, the majority of the models appear suitable for use in studies involving the North Atlantic, but some models require dedicated development effort.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danabasoglu, G</author><author>Curry, R</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Kushnir, Y</author><author>Meinen, C</author><author>Msadek, R</author><author>Patterson, M</author><author>Thompson, L</author><author>Yeager, S</author><author>Zhang, R</author><author>Office, U S CLIVAR</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2013 US AMOC Science Team Annual Report on Progress and Priorities</title></titles><periodical/><pages>162</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>Washington D.

The parameterizations differ in the transfer coefficients for heat and freshwater fluxes. In their simplest form, they are assumed constant and hence are independent of the velocity of ocean currents at the ice shelf base. An augmented melt rate parameterization accounts for frictional turbulence via transfer coefficients that do depend on boundary layer current velocities via a drag law. In simulations with both parameterizations for idealized as well as realistic cavity geometries under Pine Island Ice Shelf, West Antarctica, significant differences in melt rate patterns between the velocity-independent and velocity-dependent formulations are found. While patterns are strongly correlated to those of thermal forcing for velocity-independent transfer coefficients, melting in the case of velocity-dependent coefficients is collocated with regions of high boundary layer currents, in particular where rapid plume outflow occurs. Both positive and negative feedbacks between melt rates, boundary layer temperature, velocities, and buoyancy fluxes are identified. Melt rates are found to increase with increasing drag coefficient Cd, in agreement with plume model simulations, but optimal values of Cd inferred from plume models are not easily transferable. Uncertainties therefore remain, both regarding simulated melt rate spatial distributions and magnitudes.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Death, R</author><author>Wadham, J L</author><author>Monteiro, F</author><author>Le Brocq, A M</author><author>Tranter, M</author><author>Ridgwell, A</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Raiswell, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antarctic ice sheet fertilises the Southern Ocean</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2635-2643</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric iron deposition</keyword><keyword>cycle</keyword><keyword>dissolved iron</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>icebergs</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>primary productivity</keyword><keyword>waters</keyword><keyword>west</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-11-2635-2014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Death, R., J.

The zone bordering the Antarctic Ice Sheet exhibits high PP and seasonal plankton blooms in response to light and variations in iron availability. The sources of iron stimulating elevated SO PP are in debate. Established contributors include dust, coastal sediments/upwelling, icebergs and sea ice. Subglacial meltwater exported at the ice margin is a more recent suggestion, arising from intense iron cycling beneath the ice sheet. Icebergs and subglacial meltwater may supply a large amount of bioavailable iron to the SO, estimated in this study at 0.07-0.2 Tg yr(-1). Here we apply the MIT global ocean model (Follows et al., 2007) to determine the potential impact of this level of iron export from the ice sheet upon SO PP. The export of iron from the ice sheet raises modelled SO PP by up to 40 %, and provides one plausible explanation for seasonally very high in situ measurements of PP in the near-coastal zone. The impact on SO PP is greatest in coastal regions, which are also areas of high measured marine PP. These results suggest that the export of Antarctic runoff and icebergs may have an important impact on SO PP and should be included in future biogeochemical modelling.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dotto, T S</author><author>Kerr, R</author><author>Mata, M M</author><author>Azaneu, M</author><author>Wainer, I</author><author>Fahrbach, E</author><author>Rohardt, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of the structure and variability of Weddell Sea water masses in distinct ocean reanalysis products</title><secondary-title>Ocean Sci.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Sci.</full-title></periodical><pages>523-546</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/os-10-523-2014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dotto, T.

The recorded travel time of these signals, about 13,375 s, is a historical measure of the ocean temperature averaged across several ocean basins. The 1960 travel time measurement has about 3-s precision. High-resolution global ocean state estimates for 2004 from the “Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II” (ECCO2) project were combined with ray tracing to determine the paths followed by the acoustic signals. The acoustic paths are refracted geodesics that are slightly deflected by either small-scale topographic features in the Southern Ocean or the coast of Brazil. The refractive influences of intense, small-scale oceanographic features, such as Agulhas Rings or eddies in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, greatly reduce the necessary topographic deflection and cause the acoustic paths to meander in time. The ECCO2 ocean state estimates, which are constrained by model dynamics and available data, were used to compute present-day travel times. Measured and computed arrival coda were in good agreement. Based on recent estimates of warming of the upper ocean, the travel-time change over the past half-century was nominally expected to be about −9 s, but little difference between measured (1960) and computed (2004) travel times was found. Taking into account uncertainties in the 1960 measurements, the 2004 ocean state estimates, and other approximations, the ocean temperature averaged along the sound channel axis over the antipodal paths has warmed at a rate less than about 4.6 m °C yr−1 (95% confidence). At this time, the estimated uncertainties are comparable in size to the expected warming signal, however.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, S</author><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Nie, X W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mixed layer salinity budget in the tropical Pacific Ocean estimated by a global GCM</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>8255-8270</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>ENSO</keyword><keyword>barrier-layer</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>fresh pool</keyword><keyword>intraseasonal</keyword><keyword>salinity budget</keyword><keyword>sea-surface</keyword><keyword>simulated passive tracer</keyword><keyword>southern oscillation</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>toga decade</keyword><keyword>tropical Pacific</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>warm pool</keyword><keyword>western equatorial pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014jc010336</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gao, S., T.

The results focusing on the western Pacific freshwater pool indicate that the long-term averaged surface freshwater flux is well balanced by ocean dynamics, in which the subsurface processes account for the major part. The MLS budget shows significant seasonal and interannual variability, as a consequence of interplay among surface freshwater flux, advection, mixing, and vertical entrainment. On seasonal time scale, both the MLS and mixed layer depth are largely controlled by surface freshwater flux. The opposite phase between the subsurface processes and the barrier layer thickness confirms the important influence of the barrier layer on vertical mixing and entrainment from below. On interannual time scale, all the MLS budget terms show significant ENSO signal, which in turn is highly correlated with the salinity front and barrier layer thickness in the equatorial Pacific.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Straneo, F</author><author>Sergienko, O</author><author>Hamilton, G</author><author>Office, U S CLIVAR Project</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>International workshop on understanding the response of Greenlands marine-terminating glaciers to oceanic and atmospheric forcing: Challenges to improving observations, process understanding and modeling</title></titles><periodical/><pages>36</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>Washington D.

The success of EIFEX owes to the applied experimental strategy; namely to use the closed core of a mesoscale eddy for the iron injection. This strategy not only allowed tracking the phytoplankton bloom within the fertilized patch of mixed-layer water, but also allowed the export of biologically fixed carbon to the deep ocean to be quantified. In this present study, least-squares techniques are used to fit a regional numerical ocean circulation model with four open boundaries to temperature, salinity, and velocity observations collected during EIFEX. By adjusting the open boundary values of temperature, salinity and velocity, an optimized model is obtained that clearly improves the simulated eddy and its mixed layer compared to a first guess representation of the cyclonic eddy. A biogeochemical model, coupled to the optimized circulation model, simulates the evolution of variables such as chlorophyll a and particular organic carbon in close agreement with the observations. The estimated carbon export, however, is lower than the estimates obtained from observations without numerical modeling support. Tuning the sinking parameterization in the model increases the carbon export at the cost of unrealistically high sinking velocities. Repeating the model experiment without adding iron allows more insight into the effects of the iron fertilization. In the model this effect is about 40% lower than in previous estimates in the context of EIFEX. The likely causes for these discrepancies are potentially too high remineralization, inaccurate representation of the bloom-termination in the model, and ambiguity in budget computations and averaging. The discrepancies are discussed and improvements are suggested for the parameterization used in the biogeochemical model components.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moore, Robert M</author><author>Kienast, Markus</author><author>Fraser, Michael</author><author>Cullen, John J</author><author>Deutsch, Curtis</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J</author><author>Somes, Christopher J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extensive hydrogen supersaturations in the western South Atlantic Ocean suggest substantial underestimation of nitrogen fixation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>4340-4350</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modelin</keyword><keyword>4820 Gases</keyword><keyword>4845 Nutrients and nutrient cycling</keyword><keyword>Atlantic Ocean</keyword><keyword>dissolved hydrogen</keyword><keyword>nitrogen fixation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014JC010017</electronic-resource-num><notes>Moore, R.

Yet major uncertainties of quantification remain, particularly regarding the global oceanic nitrogen fixation rate. Hydrogen is produced during nitrogen fixation and will become supersaturated in surface waters if there is net release from diazotrophs. Ocean surveys of hydrogen supersaturation thus have the potential to illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrogen fixation and to guide the far more onerous but quantitative methods for measuring it. Here we present the first transect of high resolution measurements of hydrogen supersaturations in surface waters along a meridional 10,000 km cruise track through the Atlantic. We compare measured saturations with published measurements of nitrogen fixation rates and also with model-derived values. If the primary source of excess hydrogen is nitrogen fixation and has a hydrogen release ratio similar to Trichodesmium, our hydrogen measurements would point to similar rates of fixation in the North and South Atlantic, roughly consistent with modeled fixation rates but not with measured rates, which are lower in the south. Possible explanations would include any substantial nitrogen fixation by newly discovered diazotrophs, particularly any having a hydrogen release ratio similar to or exceeding that of Trichodesmium; undersampling of nitrogen fixation south of the equator related to excessive focus on Trichodesmium; and methodological shortcomings of nitrogen fixation techniques that cause a bias toward colonial diazotrophs relative to unicellular forms. Alternatively, our data are affected by an unknown hydrogen source that is greater in the southern half of the cruise track than the northern.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of Global-Mean Steric Sea Level Change</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>824-834</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Advection,Buoyancy,Conservation equations,Ocean ci</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00373.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

Owing to nonlinearities in the equation of state of seawater, the nature of processes contributing to recent observed global-mean steric sea level changes has not been well understood. Using a data-constrained ocean state estimate, global-mean steric sea level change over 1993–2003 is revisited, and contributions from ocean transports and surface exchanges are quantified using closed potential temperature and salinity budgets. Analyses demonstrate that estimated decadal global-mean steric sea level change results mainly from a slight, time-mean imbalance between atmospheric forcing and ocean transports over the integration period: surface heat and freshwater exchanges produce a trend in global-mean steric sea level that is mainly offset by the redistribution of potential temperature and salinity through small-scale diffusion and large-scale advection. A set of numerical experiments demonstrates that global-mean steric sea level changes simulated by ocean general circulation models are sensitive to the regional distribution of ocean heat and freshwater content changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Piecuch, C G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual Bottom Pressure Signals in the Australian-Antarctic and Bellingshausen Basins</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1456-1465</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Atm/Ocean Structure/ Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Circulation/ Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Geographic location/entity</keyword><keyword>Interannual variability</keyword><keyword>Large-scale motions</keyword><keyword>Ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>Oceanic variability</keyword><keyword>Sea level</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>Variability</keyword><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>part i</keyword><keyword>resonance</keyword><keyword>sea-level variability</keyword><keyword>southeast pacific</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-13-0223.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

Consistent with the theory of Gill and Niiler, the patterns of stronger p(b) variability are partly related to enhanced local wind curl forcing and weakened gradients in H/f, where H is ocean depth and f is the Coriolis parameter. Despite weaker H/f gradients, motions against them are sufficiently strong to play a role in balancing the local wind input. Topographic effects are as or more important than changes in f. Additionally, and contrary to the dominance of barotropic processes at subannual time scales, baroclinic effects are not negligible when balancing wind input at periods of a few years. Results highlight the emerging capability to accurately observe and estimate interannual changes in large-scale p(b) over the Southern Ocean, with implications for the interpretation of low-frequency variability in sea level in terms of steric height and heat content.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prowe, A E F</author><author>Pahlow, M</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Oschlies, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How important is diversity for capturing environmental-change responses in ecosystem models?</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>3397-3407</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-11-3397-2014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Prowe, A.

Interactions are divided into local and nonlocal. If all the energy released from the mean flow through eddy–mean flow interaction is used to support eddy growth in the same region, or if all the energy released from eddies through eddy–mean flow interaction is used to feed back to the mean flow in the same region, eddy–mean flow interaction is local; otherwise, it is nonlocal. Different regions have different characters: in the subtropical region studied in detail, interactions are dominantly local. In the Southern Ocean and Kuroshio and Gulf Stream Extension regions, they are mainly nonlocal. Geographical variability of dominant eddy–eddy and eddy–mean flow processes is a dominant factor in understanding ocean energetics.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sciascia, R</author><author>Cenedese, C</author><author>Nicolì, D</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Straneo, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of periodic intermediary flows on submarine melting of a Greenland glacier</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>7078-7098</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>0720 Glaciers</keyword><keyword>4203 Analytical modeling and laboratory experiment</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword><keyword>fjord dynamics</keyword><keyword>glacier melting</keyword><keyword>ice-ocean modeling</keyword><keyword>laboratory experiment</keyword><keyword>numerical model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014JC009953</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sciascia, R., C.

The idealized configurations broadly match that of Sermilik Fjord, southeast Greenland, a largely two layers system characterized by strong seasonal variability of subglacial discharge. Consistent with observations, the numerical results suggest that the intermediary circulation is an effective mechanism for the advection of shelf anomalies inside the fjord. In the numerical simulations, the advection mechanism is a density intrusion with a velocity which is an order of magnitude larger than the velocities associated with a glacier-driven circulation. In summer, submarine melting is mostly influenced by the discharge of surface runoff at the base of the glacier and the intermediary circulation induces small changes in submarine melting. In winter, on the other hand, submarine melting depends only on the water properties and velocity distribution at the glacier front. Hence, the properties of the waters advected by the intermediary circulation to the glacier front are found to be the primary control of the submarine melting. When the density of the intrusion is intermediate between those found in the fjord's two layers, there is a significant reduction in submarine melting. On the other hand, when the density is close to that of the bottom layer, only a slight reduction in submarine melting is observed. The numerical results compare favorably to idealized laboratory experiments with a similar setup.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seroussi, H</author><author>Morlighem, M</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Mouginot, J</author><author>Larour, E</author><author>Schodlok, M</author><author>Khazendar, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sensitivity of the dynamics of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, to climate forcing for the next 50 years</title><secondary-title>The Cryosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cryosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>1699-1710</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/tc-8-1699-2014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Seroussi, H., M.

The higher-resolution reanalyses (on the order of 1/4 degrees X 1/4 degrees) are better at reproducing the circulation pattern in the subpolar gyre than those with lower resolution (on the order of 1 degrees). Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) and Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO)-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) produce transports at 26 degrees N that are close to those observed [17 Sv (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1))]. ECCO, version 2, and SODA produce northward transports across the GSR (observed transport of 8.2 Sv) that are 22% and 29% too big, respectively. By contrast, the low-resolution reanalyses have transports that are either too small [by 31% for ECCO-JPL and 49% for Ocean Reanalysis, system 3 (ORA-S3)] or much too large [Decadal Prediction System (DePreSys)]. SODA had the best simulations of mixed layer depth and with two coarse grid long-term reanalyses (DePreSys and ORA-S3) is used to examine changes in North Atlantic circulation from 1960 to 2008. Its results suggest that the AMOC increased by about 20% at 26 degrees N while transport across the GSR hardly altered. The other (less reliable) long-term reanalyses also had small changes across the GSR but changes of +10% and -20%, respectively, at 26 degrees N. Thus, it appears that changes in the overturning circulation at 26 degrees N are decoupled from the flow across the GSR. It is recommended that transport observations should not be assimilated in ocean reanalyses but used for validation instead.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vallina, S M</author><author>Follows, M J</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Montoya, J M</author><author>Cermeno, P</author><author>Loreau, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global relationship between phytoplankton diversity and productivity in the ocean</title><secondary-title>Nat Commun</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nat Commun</full-title></periodical><volume>5</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, there are few observations and there has been little attempt to understand the mechanisms that would lead to such a shape for planktonic organisms. Here we use a marine ecosystem model together with the community assembly theory to explain the shape of the unimodal PDR we obtain at the global scale. The positive slope from low to intermediate productivity is due to grazer control with selective feeding, which leads to the predator-mediated coexistence of prey. The negative slope at high productivity is due to seasonal blooms of opportunist species that occur before they are regulated by grazers. The negative side is only unveiled when the temporal scale of the observation captures the transient dynamics, which are especially relevant at highly seasonal latitudes. Thus selective predation explains the positive side while transient competitive exclusion explains the negative side of the unimodal PDR curve. The phytoplankton community composition of the positive and negative sides is mostly dominated by slow-growing nutrient specialists and fast-growing nutrient opportunist species, respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vallina, S M</author><author>Ward, B A</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Follows, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Maximal feeding with active prey-switching: A kill-the-winner functional response and its effect on global diversity and biogeography</title><secondary-title>Progress in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Progress in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>93-109</pages><volume>120</volume><keywords><keyword>Ecosystem diversity</keyword><keyword>Foodweb stability</keyword><keyword>Ocean</keyword><keyword>Zooplankton grazing</keyword><keyword>communities</keyword><keyword>competitive-exclusion</keyword><keyword>ecosystem models</keyword><keyword>iron fertilization</keyword><keyword>mixed-layer</keyword><keyword>modeling</keyword><keyword>north-sea</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>predator</keyword><keyword>resource competition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pocean.2013.08.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vallina, S.

Current formulations of active prey-switching, however, display non-maximal feeding in which the predators' total ingestion decays exponentially with the number prey species (i.e. the diet breadth) even though the total prey biomass stays constant. We analyse three previously published multi-species functional responses which have either active switching or maximal feeding, but not both. We identify the cause of this apparent incompatibility and describe a kill-the-winner formulation that combines active switching with maximal feeding. Active switching is shown to be a community response in which some predators become preyselective and the formulations with maximal or non-maximal feeding are implicitly assuming different food web configurations. Global simulations using a marine ecosystem model with 64 phytoplankton species belonging to 4 major functional groups show that the species richness and biogeography of phytoplankton are very sensitive to the choice of the functional response for grazing. The phytoplankton biogeography reflects the balance between the competitive abilities for nutrient uptake and the degree of apparent competition which occurs indirectly between species that share a common predator species. The phytoplankton diversity significantly increases when active switching is combined with maximal feeding through predator-mediated coexistence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here such errors are derived by comparing satellite SSS observations from Aquarius and SMOS with ocean model output and in situ data. The associated data error variance maps have a complex spatial pattern, ranging from less than 0.05 in the open ocean to 1-2 (units of salinity variance) along the coasts and high latitude regions. Comparing the data-model misfits to the data errors indicates that the Aquarius and SMOS constraints could potentially affect estimated SSS values in several ocean regions, including most tropical latitudes. In reference to the Aquarius error budget, derived errors are less than the total allocation errors for the Aquarius mission accuracy requirements in low and midlatitudes, but exceed allocation errors in high latitudes.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ward, Ben A</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling spatial and temporal patterns in size-structured marine plankton communities: top–down and bottom–up controls</title><secondary-title>Journal of Plankton Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Plankton Research</full-title></periodical><pages>31-47</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/plankt/fbt097</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ward, B.

Here, we examine this theory in a more realistic context using a size-structured global ocean food-web model, together with a much simplified version of the same model for which equilibrium solutions are readily obtained. Both models include the same basic assumptions: allometric scaling of physiological traits and size-selective zooplankton grazing. According to the equilibrium model, grazing places a limit on the phytoplankton biomass within each size-class, while the supply rate of essential nutrients limits the number of coexisting size classes, and hence the total biomass, in the system. The global model remains highly consistent with this conceptual view in the large-scale, annual average sense, but reveals more complex behaviour at shorter timescales, when phytoplankton and zooplankton growth may become decoupled. In particular, we show temporal and spatial scale dependence between total phytoplankton biomass and two key ecosystem properties: the zooplankton-to-phytoplankton ratio, and the partitioning of biomass among different size classes.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Webber, B G M</author><author>Matthews, A J</author><author>Heywood, K J</author><author>Kaiser, J</author><author>Schmidtko, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seaglider observations of equatorial Indian Ocean Rossby waves associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>3714-3731</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>kelvin waves</keyword><keyword>mechanism</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>period</keyword><keyword>tropics</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>wind</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2013jc009657</electronic-resource-num><notes>Webber, B.

These high-resolution subsurface observations provide insight into equatorial ocean Rossby wave activity forced by three Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events during this time period. These Rossby waves generate variability in temperature O(1 degrees C), salinity O(0.2 g kg(-1)), density O(0.2 kg m(-3)), and oxygen concentration O(10 mu mol kg(-1)), associated with 10 m vertical displacements of the thermocline. The variability extends down to 1000 m, the greatest depth of the Seaglider observations, highlighting the importance of surface forcing for the deep equatorial ocean. The temperature variability observed by the Seaglider is greater than that simulated in the ECCO-JPL reanalysis, especially at depth. There is also marked variability in chlorophyll fluorescence at the surface and at the depth of the chlorophyll maximum. Upwelling from Rossby waves and local wind stress curl leads to an enhanced shoaling of the chlorophyll maximum by 10-25 m in response to the increased availability of nutrients and light. This influence of the MJO on primary production via equatorial ocean Rossby waves has not previously been recognized.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wortham, C</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Multidimensional Spectral Description of Ocean Variability</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>944-966</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Altimetry</keyword><keyword>Circulation</keyword><keyword>Climatology</keyword><keyword>Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Kinetic energy</keyword><keyword>Mathematical and statistical techniques</keyword><keyword>Observational techniques and algorithms</keyword><keyword>Oceanic variability</keyword><keyword>Physical Meteorology and</keyword><keyword>Rossby waves</keyword><keyword>Spectral analysis</keyword><keyword>Variability</keyword><keyword>baroclinic</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>dispersion-relation</keyword><keyword>distribution</keyword><keyword>evolution</keyword><keyword>extratropical planetary-waves</keyword><keyword>kinetic-energy</keyword><keyword>mean flow</keyword><keyword>models</keyword><keyword>number spectrum</keyword><keyword>quasi-geostrophic theory</keyword><keyword>rossby waves</keyword><keyword>rough</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-13-0113.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wortham, C., and C.

The spectrum model spans periods longer than the inertial but shorter than a decade and wavelengths between 100 and 10 000 km. Assuming geostrophic dynamics, a spectrum model for the streamfunction is constructed to be consistent with a range of observations, including sea surface height from satellite altimetry, velocity from moored and shipboard instruments, and temperature from moorings. First-order characteristics of the observed spectra, including amplitude and spectral moments, vary slowly geographically. The spectrum model is horizontally anisotropic, accommodating observations that zonal wavenumber-frequency spectra are dominated by a nondispersive line. Qualitative and quantitative agreement is found with one-dimensional frequency and wavenumber spectra and observed vertical profiles of variance. Illustrative application is made of the model spectrum to observing-system design, data mapping, and uncertainty estimation for trends.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bidecadal Thermal Changes in the Abyssal Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2013-2030</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>argo program</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>estimation</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>level rise</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic ocean</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>state</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-13-096.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., and P.

Interpretation requires close attention to the long memory of the deep ocean, implying that meteorological forcing of decades to thousands of years ago should still be producing trendlike changes in abyssal heat content. Much of the deep-ocean volume remained unobserved. At the present time, warming is seen in the deep western Atlantic and Southern Oceans, roughly consistent with those regions of the ocean expected to display the earliest responses to surface disturbances. Parts of the deeper ocean, below 3600 m, show cooling. Most of the variation in the abyssal Pacific Ocean is comparatively featureless, consistent with the slow, diffusive approach to a steady state expected there. In the global average, changes in heat content below 2000 m are roughly 10% of those inferred for the upper ocean over the 20-yr period. A useful global observing strategy for detecting future change has to be designed to account for the different time and spatial scales manifested in the observed changes. If the precision estimates of heat content change are independent of systematic errors, determining oceanic heat uptake values equivalent to 0.1 W m(-2) is possibly attainable over future bidecadal periods.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baringer, M O</author><author>Johns, W E</author><author>McCarthy, G D</author><author>Willis, J</author><author>Garzoli, S</author><author>Lankhorst, M</author><author>Meinen, C S</author><author>Send, U</author><author>Hobbs, W R</author><author>Cunningham, S A</author><author>Rayner, D</author><author>Smeed, D A</author><author>Kanzow, T</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Frajka-Williams, E</author><author>Macdonald, A</author><author>Dong, S</author><author>Marotzke, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Oceans: {Meridional} overturning circulation and heat transport observations in the {Atlantic} {Ocean}</title><secondary-title>State of the Climate in 2012</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>State of the Climate in 2012</full-title></periodical><pages>S65--S68</pages><volume>94</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><notes>Baringer, M.

This paper compares different methods of diagnosing eddy mixing rates in an idealized, eddy-resolving model of a channel flow meant to resemble the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The first set of methods, the “perfect” diagnostics, are techniques suitable only to numerical models, in which detailed synoptic data is available. The perfect diagnostic include flux-gradient diffusivities of buoyancy, QGPV, and Ertel PV; Nakamura effective diffusivity; and the four-element diffusivity tensor calculated from an ensemble of passive tracers. These diagnostics reveal a consistent picture of isopycnal mixing by eddies, with a pronounced maximum near 1000 m depth. The isopycnal diffusivity differs from the buoyancy diffusivity, a.k.a. the Gent–McWilliams transfer coefficient, which is weaker and peaks near the surface and bottom. The second set of methods are observationally “practical” diagnostics. They involve monitoring the spreading of tracers or Lagrangian particles in ways that are plausible in the field. We show how, with sufficient ensemble size, the practical diagnostics agree with the perfect diagnostics in an average sense. Some implications for eddy parameterization are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chaudhuri, A H</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Forget, G</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Comparison of Atmospheric Reanalysis Surface Products over the Ocean and Implications for Uncertainties in Air-Sea Boundary Forcing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>153-170</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>discharge</keyword><keyword>fresh-water</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>global precipitation</keyword><keyword>heat-flux</keyword><keyword>numerical weather prediction</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>sensitivity</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>turbulent fluxes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jcli-d-12-00090.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chaudhuri, A.

Four reanalysis products, namely from 1) the interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), 2) version 2 of the Common Reference Ocean-Ice Experiments (CORE2), 3) the 25-Year Japanese Reanalysis Project (JRA-25), and 4) NCEP-NCAR, are evaluated against satellite-derived observations for eight different fields (zonal and meridional winds, precipitation, specific humidity, continental discharge, surface air temperature, and downwelling longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes). No single product is found to agree better in all fields with satellite-derived observations. Reanalysis products are mostly comparable to each other because of their similar physical assumptions and assimilation of common observations. Adjusted atmospheric fields from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) optimizations are also in agreement with other reanalysis products. Time-mean and time-variable errors are estimated separately and mapped globally in space, based on 14-day average fields to focus on monthly to interannual periods. Time-variable errors are larger in comparison to the signal than time-mean errors for most fields, thus justifying the need to separate them for studying uncertainties as well as formulating optimization procedures. Precipitation and wind stress fields show significant time-mean and time-variable errors whereas downwelling radiation, air temperature, and humidity fields show small time-mean errors but large time-variable errors, particularly in the tropics. Uncertainties based on evaluating multiple products presented here are considerably larger than uncertainties based on single product pairs.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy Pathways and Structures of Oceanic Eddies from the ECCO2 State Estimate and Simplified Models</title></titles><periodical/><volume>Ph.D.</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>MIT-WHOI Joint Program</publisher><notes>Chen, R., 2013: Energy Pathways and Structures of Oceanic Eddies from the ECCO2 State Estimate and Simplified Models.

At seasonal and intraseasonal time scales, polar motions are dominated by angular momentum fluctuations due to mass redistributions and relative motions in the atmosphere, oceans, and continental water, snow, and ice. In this study, we compare the geophysical excitations derived from various global atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological models (NCEP, ECCO, ERA40, ERAinterim, and ECMWF operational products), and construct two model sets LDC1 and LDC2 by combining the above models with a least difference method. Comparisons between the geodetic excitation (derived from the polar motion series IERS EOP 08 C04) and the geophysical excitations (based on those meteorological models) imply that the atmospheric models are the most reliable while the hydrological ones are the most inaccurate; that the ERAinterim is, in general, the best model set among the original ones, but the combined models LDC1 and LDC2 are much better than ERAinterim; and that applying the frequency-dependent transfer functions to LDC1 and LDC2 improves their agreements with the geodetic excitation. Thus, we conclude that the combined models LDC1 and LDC2 are reliable, and the frequency-dependent Love numbers and polar motion transfer functions are well modeled.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clayton, Sophie</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Jahn, Oliver</author><author>Follows, Michael J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dispersal, eddies, and the diversity of marine phytoplankton</title><secondary-title>Limnology and Oceanography: Fluids and Environments</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Limnology and Oceanography: Fluids and Environments</full-title></periodical><pages>182-197</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>biodiversity</keyword><keyword>hotspots</keyword><keyword>plankton</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1215/21573689-2373515</electronic-resource-num><notes>Clayton, S., S.

Swifter current speeds, faster dispersal, and increased environmental variability in the higher-resolution model enhanced local diversity almost everywhere. In the numerical simulations, each resolved phytoplankton type was characterized as “locally adapted” at any geographical location (i.e., having net local biological production and physical export) or “immigrant” (i.e., net local biological loss but a population sustained by immigration via physical transport). Immigrants accounted for a higher fraction of the total diversity in the equatorial and subtropical regions, where the exclusion timescale is long relative to the physical transport between “provinces.” Hotspots of diversity were associated with western boundary currents and coastal upwelling regions. The former had high locally adapted diversity within the core of the current system, maintained by confluence of upstream populations and the induction of nutrient resources, as well as environmental variability associated with mesoscale eddies. Downstream of strong nutrient sources, convergence of populations led to immigrant-dominated diversity. The numerical simulations provide testable predictions of patterns in diversity and hypotheses regarding the mechanisms that control them. Molecular approaches to characterizing diversity in microbial populations will provide a means to test these hypotheses.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Condron, Alan</author><author>Renfrew, Ian A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of polar mesoscale storms on northeast Atlantic Ocean circulation</title><secondary-title>Nature Geosci</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Geosci</full-title></periodical><pages>34-37</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ngeo1661</electronic-resource-num><notes>Condron, A., and I.

Predictions for arrival patterns using annual average WOA05 fields match observations to within small travel time offsets (0.3–1.0 s). Predictions for arrival patterns from the models differ substantially from the measured arrival patterns, from the WOA05 climatology, and from each other, both in terms of travel time and in the structure of the arrival patterns. The acoustic arrival patterns are sensitive to the vertical gradients of sound speed that govern acoustic propagation. Basin-scale acoustic transmissions, therefore, provide stringent tests of the vertical temperature structure of ocean state estimates. This structure ultimately influences the mixing between the surface waters and the ocean interior. The relatively good agreement of the acoustic data with the more recent ECCO solutions indicates that numerical ocean models have reached a level of accuracy where the acoustic data can provide useful additional constraints for ocean state estimation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenty, I</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrographic Preconditioning for Seasonal Sea Ice Anomalies in the Labrador Sea</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>863-883</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>baffin-bay</keyword><keyword>boundary-layer</keyword><keyword>cover</keyword><keyword>deep convection</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>greenland sea</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic circulation</keyword><keyword>upper ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-12-064.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fenty, I., and P.

The analysis is based on an ocean and sea ice state estimate covering the summer-to-summer 1996/97 annual cycle. The estimate is a synthesis of in situ and satellite hydrographic and ice data with a regional coupled 1/3 degrees ocean-sea ice model. SI advective processes are first demonstrated to be required to reproduce the observed ice extent. With advection, the marginal ice zone (MIZ) location stabilizes where ice melt balances ice mass convergence, a quasi-equilibrium condition achieved via the convergence of warm subtropical-origin subsurface waters into the mixed layer seaward of the MIZ. An analysis of ocean surface buoyancy fluxes reveals a critical role of low-salinity upper ocean (100 m) anomalies for the advancement of SI seaward of the Arctic Water-Irminger Water Thermohaline Front. Anomalous low-salinity waters slow the rate of buoyancy loss-driven mixed layer deepening, shielding an advancing SI pack from the warm subsurface waters, and are conducive to a positive surface meltwater stabilization enhancement (MESEM) feedback driven by SI meltwater release. The low-salinity upper-ocean hydrographic conditions in which the MESEM efficiently operates are termed sea ice-preconditioned waters (SIPW). The SI extent seaward of the Thermohaline Front is shown to closely correspond to the distribution of SIPW. The analysis of two additional state estimates (1992/93, 2003/04) suggests that interannual hydrographic variability provides a first-order explanation for SI maximum extent anomalies in the region.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenty, I</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coupled Sea Ice-Ocean-State Estimation in the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>884-904</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>cover</keyword><keyword>deep convection</keyword><keyword>eddies</keyword><keyword>fresh-water</keyword><keyword>greenland</keyword><keyword>heat fluxes</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic sst</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>western boundary currents</keyword><keyword>winter circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-12-065.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fenty, I., and P.

Historically, quantifying the relationship between sea ice and ocean variability has been difficult because of in situ observation paucity and technical challenges associated with synthesizing observations with numerical models. Here the relationship between ice and ocean variability is explored by analyzing new estimates of the ocean-ice state in the northwest North Atlantic. The estimates are syntheses of in situ and satellite hydrographic and ice data with a regional 1/3 degrees coupled ocean-sea ice model. The synthesis of sea ice data is achieved with an improved adjoint of a thermodynamic ice model. Model and data are made consistent, in a least squares sense, by iteratively adjusting control variables, including ocean initial and lateral boundary conditions and the atmospheric state, to minimize an uncertainty-weighted model-data misfit cost function. The utility of the state estimate is demonstrated in an analysis of energy and buoyancy budgets in the marginal ice zone (MIZ). In mid-March the system achieves a state of quasi-equilibrium during which net ice growth and melt approaches zero; newly formed ice diverges from coastal areas and converges via wind and ocean forcing in the MIZ. The convergence of ice mass in the MIZ is ablated primarily by turbulent ocean-ice enthalpy fluxes. The primary source of the enthalpy required for sustained MIZ ice ablation is the sensible heat reservoir of the subtropical-origin subsurface waters.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Wang, Ou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Origins of heat and freshwater anomalies underlying regional decadal sea level trends</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>563-567</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>1641 Sea level change</keyword><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4263 Ocean predictability and prediction</keyword><keyword>4513 Decadal ocean variability</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>sea level rise</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/grl.50164</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., and O.

The system integrates the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) assimilation package with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ocean general circulation model (MITgcm). The MITgcm/DART system supports the assimilation of a wide range of ocean observations and uses an ensemble approach to solve the nonlinear assimilation problems. The GoM prediction system was implemented with an eddy-resolving 1/10th degree configuration of the MITgcm. Assimilation experiments were performed over a 6-month period between May and October during a strong loop current event in 1999. The model was sequentially constrained with weekly satellite sea surface temperature and altimetry data. Experiments results suggest that the ensemble-based assimilation system shows a high predictive skill in the GoM, with estimated ensemble spread mainly concentrated around the front of the loop current. Further analysis of the system estimates demonstrates that the ensemble assimilation accurately reproduces the observed features without imposing any negative impact on the dynamical balance of the system. Results from sensitivity experiments with respect to the ensemble filter parameters are also presented and discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kalmikov, Alexander G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Uncertainty Quantification in ocean state estimation</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>MIT-WHOI Joint Program</publisher><notes>Kalmikov, A.

Robust estimates of the magnitude and variability of the storage and distribution of C-ant in the ocean are therefore important for understanding the human impact on climate. In this synthesis we review observational and model-based estimates of the storage and transport of C-ant in the ocean. We pay particular attention to the uncertainties and potential biases inherent in different inference schemes. On a global scale, three data-based estimates of the distribution and inventory of C-ant are now available. While the inventories are found to agree within their uncertainty, there are considerable differences in the spatial distribution. We also present a review of the progress made in the application of inverse and data assimilation techniques which combine ocean interior estimates of C-ant with numerical ocean circulation models. Such methods are especially useful for estimating the air-sea flux and interior transport of C-ant, quantities that are otherwise difficult to observe directly. However, the results are found to be highly dependent on modeled circulation, with the spread due to different ocean models at least as large as that from the different observational methods used to estimate C-ant. Our review also highlights the importance of repeat measurements of hydro-graphic and biogeochemical parameters to estimate the storage of C-ant on decadal timescales in the presence of the variability in circulation that is neglected by other approaches. Data-based C-ant estimates provide important constraints on forward ocean models, which exhibit both broad similarities and regional errors relative to the observational fields. A compilation of inventories of C-ant gives us a &quot;best&quot; estimate of the global ocean inventory of anthropogenic carbon in 2010 of 155 +/- 31 PgC (+/- 20% uncertainty). This estimate includes a broad range of values, suggesting that a combination of approaches is necessary in order to achieve a robust quantification of the ocean sink of anthropogenic CO2.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khazendar, A</author><author>Schodlok, M P</author><author>Fenty, I</author><author>Ligtenberg, S R M</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>van den Broeke, M R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observed thinning of Totten Glacier is linked to coastal polynya variability</title><secondary-title>Nat Commun</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nat Commun</full-title></periodical><volume>4</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

After accounting for firn compaction anomalies, the thinning appears to coincide with fast-flowing ice indicating a dynamical origin. Here, to elucidate these observations, we apply high-resolution ice–ocean modelling. Totten Ice Shelf is simulated to have higher, more variable basal melting rates. We link this variability to the volume of cold water, originating in polynyas upon sea ice formation, reaching the sub-ice-shelf cavity. Hence, we propose that the observed increased thinning of Totten Glacier is due to enhanced basal melting caused by a decrease in cold polynya water reaching its cavity. We support this hypothesis with passive microwave data of polynya extent variability. Considering the widespread changes in sea ice conditions, this mechanism could be contributing extensively to ice-shelf instability.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manizza, M</author><author>Follows, M J</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Hill, C N</author><author>Key, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes in the Arctic Ocean CO2 sink (1996–2007): A regional model analysis</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>1108-1118</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>0428 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>ocean productivity</keyword><keyword>sea ice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2012GB004491</electronic-resource-num><notes>Manizza, M., M.

We use a regional physical-biogeochemical model of the Arctic Ocean, forced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research atmospheric reanalysis, to evaluate the mean present-day CO2 sink and its temporal evolution. During the 1996–2007 period, the model suggests that the Arctic average sea surface temperature warmed by 0.04°C a−1, that sea ice area decreased by ∼0.1 × 106 km2 a−1, and that the biological drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon increased. The simulated 1996–2007 time-mean Arctic Ocean CO2 sink is 58 ± 6 Tg C a−1. The increase in ice-free ocean area and consequent carbon drawdown during this period enhances the CO2 sink by ∼1.4 Tg C a−1, consistent with estimates based on extrapolations of sparse data. A regional analysis suggests that during the 1996–2007 period, the shelf regions of the Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas experienced an increase in the efficiency of their biological pump due to decreased sea ice area, especially during the 2004–2007 period, consistent with independently published estimates of primary production. In contrast, the CO2 sink in the Barents Sea is reduced during the 2004–2007 period due to a dominant control by warming and decreasing solubility. Thus, the effect of decreasing sea ice area and increasing sea surface temperature partially cancel, though the former is dominant.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Ferrari, Raffaele</author><author>Schneider, Tapio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Force Balance of the Southern Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1193-1208</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Southern Ocean,Forcing,Meridional overturning circ</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-12-069.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mazloff, M.

The buoyancy transport in the SO is dominated by the upper and middle MOC cells, with the middle cell accounting for most of the buoyancy transport across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. A Southern Ocean state estimate for the years 2005 and 2006 with ⅙° resolution is used to determine the forces balancing this MOC. Diagnosing the zonal momentum budget in density space allows an exact determination of the adiabatic and diapycnal components balancing the thickness-weighted (residual) meridional transport. It is found that, to lowest order, the transport consists of an eddy component, a directly wind-driven component, and a component in balance with mean pressure gradients. Nonvanishing time-mean pressure gradients arise because isopycnal layers intersect topography or the surface in a circumpolar integral, leading to a largely geostrophic MOC even in the latitude band of Drake Passage. It is the geostrophic water mass transport in the surface layer where isopycnals outcrop that accomplishes the poleward buoyancy transport.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morlighem, M</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Mouginot, J</author><author>Wu, X</author><author>Seroussi, H</author><author>Larour, E</author><author>Paden, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-resolution bed topography mapping of Russell Glacier, Greenland, inferred from Operation IceBridge data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>1015-1023</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>218</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/2013JoG12J235</electronic-resource-num><notes>Morlighem, M., E.

Such maps are traditionally obtained using airborne radarsounding profiler data interpolated onto regular grids using geostatistical tools such as kriging. Here we compare three mapping techniques applied to a dense radar survey of Russell Glacier, West Greenland, by NASA Operation IceBridge: (1) radar tomography (RT) processing of the radar data to map the bed elevation, (2) interpolation of radar-derived thickness by ordinary kriging (KR) and (3) reconstruction of ice thickness based on the principles of mass conservation (MC) combining radar-sounding profiler and ice motion data. RT eliminates ambiguities caused by off-nadir reflections, but is spatially limited. KR yields a standard error in bed elevation of 35 m, but large errors (&gt;300m a-1) in flux divergence when combined with ice motion data. MC yields a comparable performance in bed elevation mapping, and errors smaller than 1m a-1 in flux divergence. When the number of radar-sounding tracks is reduced, the performance of KR decreases more rapidly than for MC. Our study site shows that MC is capable of maintaining precision levels of 60m at 400m posting with flight tracks separated by 5 km. © 2014 Publishing Technology.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morlighem, M</author><author>Seroussi, H</author><author>Larour, E</author><author>Rignot, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inversion of basal friction in Antarctica using exact and incomplete adjoints of a higher-order model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface</full-title></periodical><pages>1746-1753</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>0726 Ice sheets</keyword><keyword>0758 Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>0774 Dynamics</keyword><keyword>0798 Modeling</keyword><keyword>3260 Inverse theory</keyword><keyword>basal friction</keyword><keyword>exact adjoint</keyword><keyword>incomplete adjoint</keyword><keyword>inverse method</keyword><keyword>large-scale modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgrf.20125</electronic-resource-num><notes>Morlighem, M., H.

Here we use a complete map of surface velocity of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to infer the basal friction over the entire continent by combining these observations with a three-dimensional, thermomechanical, higher-order ice sheet numerical model from the Ice Sheet System Model open source software. We demonstrate that inverse methods can be readily applied at the continental scale with appropriate selections of cost function and of scheme of regularization, at a spatial resolution as high as 3 km along the coastline. We compare the convergence of two descent algorithms with the exact and incomplete adjoints to show that the incomplete adjoint is an excellent approximation. The results reveal that the driving stress is almost entirely balanced by the basal shear stress over 80% of the ice sheet. The basal friction coefficient, which relates basal friction to basal velocity, is, however, significantly heterogeneous: it is low on fast moving ice and high near topographic divides. Areas with low values extend far out into the interior, along glacier and ice stream tributaries, almost to the flanks of topographic divides, suggesting that basal sliding is widespread beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peng, P</author><author>Zhu, Y Z</author><author>Zhong, M</author><author>Yan, H M</author><author>Kang, K X</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Annual sea level fingerprint caused by global water mass transport</title><secondary-title>Chinese Journal of Geophysics-Chinese Edition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Journal of Geophysics-Chinese Edition</full-title></periodical><pages>824-833</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Earth</keyword><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>Ocean bottom pressure</keyword><keyword>Sea level</keyword><keyword>Self-attraction</keyword><keyword>Tide gauges</keyword><keyword>equation</keyword><keyword>gravimetry</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>reevaluation</keyword><keyword>rotating earth</keyword><keyword>rotation effect</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.6038/cjg20130311</electronic-resource-num><notes>Peng, P., Y.

The effects of water exchange among Atmosphere, Hydrology and Ocean (AHO) are always seen as a uniform thin layer. But in fact, it has been demonstrated that the mass exchange among AHO will result in a highly nonuniform patterns of sea level change due to the crust deformation and self-attraction loading (SAL) effect called sea-level fingerprints. Generally, ocean model obeys the Boussinesq hypothesis that volume conserves while ignoring the SAL effect. Here we analyze the SAL effect of AHO during 2003 and 2010 through solving the sea level function. The main results are: (1) while considering SAL effect, the spatial patterns in the annual terms of sea level changes vary significantly especially near coastal areas and at low-latitude regions. The maximum amplitude can reach 1. 3 similar to 19 mm. (2) At annual time-scale, the impact of hydrology is maximal, and less is atmosphere and ocean, while SAL effect caused by ocean has the most complex phase spatial distribution. (3) When SAL effect is included in ocean ECCO OBP model, it can explain more 5. 3% variance reduction from a global set of tide gauges.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Buoyancy-Driven Interannual Sea Level Changes in the Tropical South Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>533-547</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>South Atlantic Ocean,Buoyancy,Rossby waves,Barocli</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-12-093.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

While skillful in some regions, these processes alone cannot explain low levels of interannual sea level variability observed in the tropical Atlantic. In this study, through a set of modeling approaches, interannual sea level changes in the tropical South Atlantic are attributed and the dynamical influence of buoyancy forcing is elucidated. Similar to recent findings in the southeast tropical Pacific, sea level patterns in the tropical South Atlantic (as estimated from a data-constrained ocean general circulation model) are found to result from the action of both surface wind and buoyancy forcing; in addition to static local effects, the buoyancy-driven changes comprise important nonlocal ocean dynamical processes. It is shown that the buoyancy-driven sea level changes can be understood within the framework of a linear first baroclinic mode Rossby wave model forced by atmospheric fields and variability along the eastern boundary. To lowest order, the linear model framework also reproduces qualitative patterns of basinwide compensation between wind- and buoyancy-driven sea level changes, which are mostly tied to the anticorrelation of both surface and boundary forcing. Results suggest that the ocean’s dynamical adjustment to buoyancy forcing exerts an important influence on interannual sea level changes across all tropical oceans.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Gao, S</author><author>Fine, R A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subduction of South Pacific Tropical Water and Its Equatorward Pathways as Shown by a Simulated Passive Tracer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1551-1565</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>displacements</keyword><keyword>formation rates</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>origin</keyword><keyword>project</keyword><keyword>subtropical underwater</keyword><keyword>warm pool</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-12-0180.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Qu, T.

The results show that approximately 5.8 Sv (1 Sv 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) of the SPTW is formed in the subtropical South Pacific Ocean within the density range between 24.0 and 25.0 kg m(-3), of which about 87% is due to vertical pumping and 13% is due to lateral induction, comparing reasonably well with estimates from climatological data. Once subducted, most SPTW spreads in the subtropical South Pacific. Because of the presence of mixing, some portion of the water is transformed, and its tracer-weighted density steadily increases from an initial value of 24.4 to nearly 25.0 kg m(-3) after 13 years of integration. Approximately 42% of the water makes its way into the equatorial Pacific, either through the western boundary or interior pathway. The two equatorward pathways are essentially of equal importance. A large (similar to 70%) portion of the SPTW entering the equatorial region resurfaces in the central equatorial Pacific. The potential impacts of the resurfacing SPTW on the equatorial thermocline and surface stratification are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Gao, S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Formation of salinity maximum water and its contribution to the overturning circulation in the North Atlantic as revealed by a global general circulation model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>1982-1994</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>North Atlantic</keyword><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>deep</keyword><keyword>formation</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>pathways</keyword><keyword>salinity maximum</keyword><keyword>sea-surface salinity</keyword><keyword>trends</keyword><keyword>tropical atlantic</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>ventilation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgrc.20152</electronic-resource-num><notes>Qu, T.

The results reveal that most salinity maximum water in the North Atlantic comes from the northwestern part of the subtropical gyre, and direct contribution from the evaporation-precipitation maximum region via the surface Ekman current is minor. Water originating from the evaporation-precipitation maximum region has to recirculate in the subtropical gyre before entering the sea surface salinity maximum region from the northwest. Once subducted, some portion (similar to 10%) of the salinity maximum water enters the equatorial region in the shallow subtropical cell, but most (similar to 70%) of it appears to turn northward to join the North Atlantic Deep Water. The latter pathway involves a three-dimensional circulation. When the warm, fresh surface water flows northward along the western boundary, it turns eastward in the northern subtropical gyre. As a result of the large excess of evaporation over precipitation, this water gradually gains its salinity on the route, until it reaches the sea surface salinity maximum region in the central subtropical gyre. From there, the salinity maximum water is subducted and flows back to the western boundary in the depth range of the thermocline. With its high-salinity nature, a major portion of this water penetrates into the subpolar region and directly contributes to the deep thermohaline circulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roquet, Fabien</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Guinet, Christophe</author><author>Reverdin, Gilles</author><author>Charrassin, Jean-Benoit</author><author>Bailleul, Frederic</author><author>Costa, Daniel P</author><author>Huckstadt, Luis A</author><author>Goetz, Kimberly T</author><author>Kovacs, Kit M</author><author>Lydersen, Christian</author><author>Biuw, Martin</author><author>Nøst, Ole A</author><author>Bornemann, Horst</author><author>Ploetz, Joachim</author><author>Bester, Marthan N</author><author>McIntyre, Trevor</author><author>Muelbert, Monica C</author><author>Hindell, Mark A</author><author>McMahon, Clive R</author><author>Williams, Guy</author><author>Harcourt, Robert</author><author>Field, Iain C</author><author>Chafik, Leon</author><author>Nicholls, Keith W</author><author>Boehme, Lars</author><author>Fedak, Mike A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimates of the Southern Ocean general circulation improved by animal-borne instruments</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>6176-6180</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4283 Water masses</keyword><keyword>4594 Instruments and techniques</keyword><keyword>4858 Population dynamics and ecology</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>animal-borne sampling</keyword><keyword>hydrography</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2013GL058304</electronic-resource-num><notes>Roquet, F., and Coauthors, 2013: Estimates of the Southern Ocean general circulation improved by animal-borne instruments.

A calibrated collection of seal-derived hydrographic data is now available, consisting of more than 165,000 profiles. The value of these hydrographic data within the existing Southern Ocean observing system is demonstrated herein by conducting two state estimation experiments, differing only in the use or not of seal data to constrain the system. Including seal-derived data substantially modifies the estimated surface mixed-layer properties and circulation patterns within and south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

Because grid resolution is not the same as feature resolution, a method is needed to objectively determine the resolution capability and accuracy of SST analysis products. Ocean model SST fields are used in this study as simulated “true” SST data and subsampled based on actual infrared and microwave satellite data coverage. The subsampled data are used to simulate sampling errors due to missing data. Two different SST analyses are considered and run using both the full and the subsampled model SST fields, with and without additional noise. The results are compared as a function of spatial scales of variability using wavenumber auto- and cross-spectral analysis.The spectral variance at high wavenumbers (smallest wavelengths) is shown to be attenuated relative to the true SST because of smoothing that is inherent to both analysis procedures. Comparisons of the two analyses (both having grid sizes of roughly ) show important differences. One analysis tends to reproduce small-scale features more accurately when the high-resolution data coverage is good but produces more spurious small-scale noise when the high-resolution data coverage is poor. Analysis procedures can thus generate small-scale features with and without data, but the small-scale features in an SST analysis may be just noise when high-resolution data are sparse. Users must therefore be skeptical of high-resolution SST products, especially in regions where high-resolution (~5 km) infrared satellite data are limited because of cloud cover.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sciascia, R</author><author>Straneo, F</author><author>Cenedese, C</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal variability of submarine melt rate and circulation in an East Greenland fjord</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>2492-2506</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>0720 Glaciers</keyword><keyword>0798 Modeling</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>fjord dynamics</keyword><keyword>ice-ocean interaction</keyword><keyword>ocean modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgrc.20142</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sciascia, R., F.

The model configuration and water properties are based on data collected in Sermilik Fjord near Helheim Glacier, a major Greenland outlet glacier. The approximately two-layer stratification of the fjord's ambient waters causes the meltwater plume at the glacier front to drive a “double cell” circulation with two distinct outflows, one at the free surface and one at the layers' interface. In summer, the discharge of surface runoff at the base of the glacier (subglacial discharge) causes the circulation to be much more vigorous and associated with a larger melt rate than in winter. The simulated “double cell” circulation is consistent, in both seasons, with observations from Sermilik Fjord. Seasonal differences are also present in the vertical structure of the melt rate, which is maximum at the base of the glacier in summer and at the layers' interface in winter. Simulated submarine melt rates are strongly sensitive to the amount of subglacial discharge, to changes in water temperature, and to the height of the layers. They are also consistent with those inferred from simplified one-dimensional models based on the theory of buoyant plumes. Our results also indicate that to correctly represent the dynamics of the meltwater plume, care must be taken in the choice of viscosity and diffusivity values in the model.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seo, H</author><author>Xie, S P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of ocean warm layer thickness on the intensity of hurricane Katrina in a regional coupled model</title><secondary-title>Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics</full-title></periodical><pages>19-32</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>gulf-of-mexico</keyword><keyword>heat-content</keyword><keyword>loop current</keyword><keyword>north pacific</keyword><keyword>prediction scheme ships</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>steady state hurricanes</keyword><keyword>thermal structure</keyword><keyword>tropical cyclone intensity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00703-013-0275-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Seo, H., and S.

The Estimating Circulation and Climate of Ocean (ECCO) ocean state estimate is used to initialize the ocean component of the coupled model, and the source of deficiencies in the simulation of Katrina intensity is investigated in relation to the initial depth of 26 A degrees C isotherm (D26). The model underestimates the intensity of Katrina partly due to shallow D26 in ECCO. Sensitivity tests with various ECCO initial fields indicate that the correct relationship between intensity and D26 cannot be derived because D26 variability is underestimated in ECCO. A series of idealized experiments is carried out by modifying initial ECCO D26 to match the observed range. A more reasonable relationship between Katrina's intensity and pre-storm D26 emerges: the intensity is much more sensitive to D26 than to sea surface temperature (SST). Ocean mixed layer process plays a critical role in modulating inner-core SSTs when D26 is deep, reducing mixed layer cooling and lowering the center pressure of the Katrina. Our result lends strong support to the notion that accurate initialization of pre-storm subsurface thermal structure in prediction models is critical for a skillful forecast of intensity of Katrina and likely other intense storms.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Speer, K</author><author>Forget, G</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Siedler, G</author><author>Griffies, S M</author><author>Gould, J</author><author>Church, J A</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Global distribution and formation of mode waters</title><secondary-title>Ocean Circulation and Climate: a 21st Century Perspective</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Circulation and Climate: a 21st Century Perspective</full-title></periodical><pages>211-226</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Academic Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/B978-0-12-391851- 2.00009-X</electronic-resource-num><notes>Speer, K., and G.

Increased submarine melting is thought to have triggered the retreat of Greenland's outlet glaciers, which is partly responsible for the ice loss. However, the chain of events and physical processes remain elusive. Recent evidence suggests that an anomalous inflow of subtropical waters driven by atmospheric changes, multidecadal natural ocean variability and a long-term increase in the North Atlantic's upper ocean heat content since the 1950s all contributed to a warming of the subpolar North Atlantic. This led, in conjunction with increased runoff, to enhanced submarine glacier melting. Future climate projections raise the potential for continued increases in warming and ice-mass loss, with implications for sea level and climate.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Straneo, Fiammetta</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Sergienko, Olga</author><author>Hamilton, Gordon</author><author>Catania, Ginny</author><author>Griffies, Stephen</author><author>Hallberg, Robert</author><author>Jenkins, Adrian</author><author>Joughin, Ian</author><author>Motyka, Roman</author><author>Pfeffer, W Tad</author><author>Price, Stephen F</author><author>Rignot, Eric</author><author>Scambos, Ted</author><author>Truffer, Martin</author><author>Vieli, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Challenges to Understanding the Dynamic Response of Greenland's Marine Terminating Glaciers to Oceanic and Atmospheric Forcing</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>1131-1144</pages><volume>94</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00100.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Straneo, F., and Coauthors, 2013: Challenges to Understanding the Dynamic Response of Greenland’s Marine Terminating Glaciers to Oceanic and Atmospheric Forcing.

The widespread, near-synchronous glacier retreat, and its coincidence with a period of oceanic and atmospheric warming, suggests a common climate driver. Evidence points to the marine margins of these glaciers as the region from which changes propagated inland. Yet, the forcings and mechanisms behind these dynamic responses are poorly understood and are either missing or crudely parameterized in climate and ice sheet models. Resulting projected sea level rise contributions from Greenland by 2100 remain highly uncertain. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge and highlights key physical aspects of Greenland's coupled ice sheet–ocean–atmosphere system. Three research thrusts are identified to yield fundamental insights into ice sheet, ocean, sea ice, and atmosphere interactions, their role in Earth's climate system, and probable trajectories of future changes: 1) focused process studies addressing critical glacier, ocean, atmosphere, and coupled dynamics; 2) sustained observations at key sites; and 3) inclusion of relevant dynamics in Earth system models. Understanding the dynamic response of Greenland's glaciers to climate forcing constitutes both a scientific and technological frontier, given the challenges of obtaining the appropriate measurements from the glaciers' marine termini and the complexity of the dynamics involved, including the coupling of the ocean, atmosphere, glacier, and sea ice systems. Interdisciplinary and international cooperation are crucial to making progress on this novel and complex problem.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tenzer, Robert</author><author>Dayoub, Nadim</author><author>Abdalla, Ahmed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of a relative offset between vertical datums at the North and South Islands of New Zealand</title><secondary-title>Applied Geomatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Geomatics</full-title></periodical><pages>133-145</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12518-013-0106-8</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tenzer, R., N.

The relation between these two leveling networks and the Word Height System was then defined using GPS-leveling data and the EGM08 global geopotential model. In this study, we investigate the relative offset between these two vertical datum realizations. This is done based on comparison of the geometric geoid/quasigeoid heights (obtained from GPS and newly adjusted leveling data) with the regional gravimetric geoid/quasigeoid solutions. Moreover, oceanographic and geodetic models of mean dynamic topography (MDT) are used to assess the relative offset between these two vertical datum realizations through the analysis of regional spatial variations of mean sea level (MSL). The comparison of GPS-leveling data with regional gravimetric solutions reveals large systematic distortions (exceeding several decimeters across New Zealand) between the geometric and gravimetric geoid/quasigeoid heights attributed mainly to systematic errors within regional gravimetric solutions. The presence of a significant offset between the vertical datum realizations at the North and South Islands is not confirmed. The MSL difference between tide gauges in Wellington and Dunedin of ∼24 cm is estimated based on the analysis of MDT models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tulloch, Ross R</author><author>Hill, Chris C</author><author>Jahn, Oliver O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Possible Spreadings Of Buoyant Plumes And Local Coastline Sensitivities Using Flow Syntheses From 1992 To 2007</title><secondary-title>Monitoring and Modeling the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: A Record-Breaking Enterprise</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Monitoring and Modeling the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: A Record-Breaking Enterprise</full-title></periodical><pages>245-255</pages><keywords><keyword>Loop Current</keyword><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>floats</keyword><keyword>oil spill</keyword><keyword>spreading</keyword><keyword>tracer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>American Geophysical Union</publisher><isbn>9781118666753</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GM001125</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tulloch, R.

However, direct observations of F and its components are sparse and available estimates have substantial uncertainties. In this study we investigate if measurements of sea-surface salinity ( S) can provide an alternative indirect method for estimating F. We examine the relationship between S, F and oceanic fluxes from surface advection and mixing processes, on time scales from months to years, using a consistent estimate of the ocean/atmosphere state obtained from model/data synthesis produced by the ECCO (Estimating Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) consortium. ECCO salinity averaged over the mixed layer is used as an estimate of S. Budget analysis shows that variability in S tendencies can be attributed to both F and oceanic fluxes, demonstrating the importance of the ocean's role in evolution of S, for both local and global mean fields. Regression analysis of the 13 year long ECCO fields shows that there are only a few regions (e.g., subtropical gyres) where S can be used as a proxy for F using linear models, and only at monthly to annual time scales. Results are similar over a range of spatial scales from ∼100 to 2000 km. Findings are discussed in the context of the general sensitivities of S to atmospheric and oceanic processes and the potential of satellite salinity measurements to constrain estimates of F.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L</author><author>Landerer, Felix W</author><author>Kirillov, Sergey A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The genesis of sea level variability in the Barents Sea</title><secondary-title>Continental Shelf Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Continental Shelf Research</full-title></periodical><pages>92-104</pages><volume>66</volume><keywords><keyword>Arctic seas</keyword><keyword>Barents Sea</keyword><keyword>ECCO2</keyword><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>Satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>Sea level variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.csr.2013.07.007</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

The present study explores the nature of sea level variability in the Barents Sea—a marginal shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. A characteristic feature that distinguishes this sea from other Arctic shelf seas is that it is largely ice free throughout the year. This allows continuous monitoring of sea level by space-borne altimeters. In this work we combine satellite altimetry, ocean gravity measurements by GRACE satellites, available hydrography data, and a high-resolution ocean data synthesis product to estimate the steric and mass-related components of sea level in the Barents Sea. We present one of the first observational evidence of the local importance of the mass-related sea level changes. The observed 1–3 month phase lag between the annual cycles of sea level in the Barents Sea and in the Nordic seas (Norwegian, Iceland, Greenland seas) is explained by the annual mass-related changes. The analysis of the barotropic vorticity budget shows that the mass-related sea level variability in the central part of the Barents Sea is determined by the combined effect of wind stress, flow over the varying bottom topography, and dissipation, while the impact of vorticity fluxes is negligible. Overall, the steric sea level has smaller amplitudes and mainly varies on the seasonal time scale. The thermosteric sea level is the main contributor to the steric sea level along the pathways of the Atlantic inflow into the Barents Sea. The relative contribution of the halosteric sea level is dominant in the southeastern, eastern, and northern parts of the Barents Sea, modulated by the seasonal sea ice formation/melt as well as by continental runoff. The variability of the thermosteric sea level in the Barents Sea is mostly driven by variations in the net surface heat flux, whereas the contribution of heat advection becomes as important as the ocean-atmosphere heat exchange at interannual time scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L</author><author>Landerer, Felix W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nonseasonal fluctuations of the Arctic Ocean mass observed by the GRACE satellites</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>6451-6460</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>1217 Time variable gravity</keyword><keyword>1223 Ocean/Earth/atmosphere/hydrosphere/cryosphere</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>ECCO2</keyword><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>nonseasonal variability</keyword><keyword>ocean mass</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2013JC009341</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

Here, we examine the nature and driving forces behind those fluctuations. We find that the nonseasonal variability of the Arctic Ocean mass is strongly coupled to wind forcing. The zonal wind pattern is correlated with a dipole pattern of Arctic Ocean mass changes. Westerly wind intensification over the North Atlantic at about 60°N as well as over the Russian Arctic continental shelf break cause the ocean mass to decrease in the Nordic seas and in the central Arctic, and to increase over the Russian Arctic shelf. Basin-wide Arctic Ocean mass fluctuations are correlated with northward wind anomalies over the northeastern North Atlantic and Nordic seas, and over the Bering Sea. We show that positive (negative) Arctic Ocean mass anomalies are associated with anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomalies of the large-scale ocean circulation pattern. Based on ocean model simulations, we conclude that the observed nonseasonal Arctic Ocean mass variability is mostly explained by the net horizontal wind-driven transports, and the contribution of fresh water fluxes is negligible. We demonstrate that transport anomalies across both the Atlantic and Pacific gateways were equally important for generating large Arctic Ocean mass anomalies in 2011.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ward, Ben A</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Moore, C Mark</author><author>Follows, Michael J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Iron, phosphorus, and nitrogen supply ratios define the biogeography of nitrogen fixation</title><secondary-title>Limnology and Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Limnology and Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2059-2075</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4319/lo.2013.58.6.2059</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ward, B.

The theory explains the global biogeography of diazotrophs and the observed large-scale variations in surface ocean nutrient concentrations. The ratios in which N, P, and Fe are delivered to the surface ocean, relative to the demands of the phytoplankton community, define several biogeochemical provinces in terms of the limiting nutrients and the presence or absence of diazotrophs. Nutrient supply ratios provided by a global ecosystem model support the theoretical view that diazotroph biogeography is dominated by the Fe : N supply ratio, with the P : N supply ratio taking an important secondary role. The theory yields robust predictions for which strong empirical support is found in global observations of surface nutrient concentrations and diazotroph abundance.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wortham IV, Cimarron James Lemuel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A multi-dimensional spectral description of ocean variability with application</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>MIT-WHOI Joint Program</publisher><notes>Wortham IV, C.

To be worthwhile, any nonlinear method would need to exhibit greater skill, and so a rough baseline from which to judge more complex methods is the goal. A 16-year ocean state estimate is used, under the assumption that internal oceanic variability is dominating externally imposed changes. No evidence exists of significant nonlinearity in the bulk of the system over this time span. Linear predictability is the story of time and space correlations, and some predictive skill exists for a few months in SST, with some minor capability extending to a few years. Sixteen years is, however, far too short for an evaluation for interannual, much less decadal, variability, although orders of magnitude are likely stably estimated. The meridional structure of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), defined as the time-varying vertical integral to the maximum meridional volume transport at each latitude, shows nearly complete decorrelation in the variability across about 35°N—the Gulf Stream system. If a time-scale exists displaying coherence of the MOC between subpolar and subtropical gyres, it lies beyond the existing observation duration, and that has consequences for observing system strategies and the more general problem of detectability of change.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Baroclinic Motions and Energetics as Measured by Altimeters</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>140-150</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Eddies,Tides,Satellite observations,Baroclinic mod</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JTECH-D-12-00035.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2013: Baroclinic Motions and Energetics as Measured by Altimeters.

Those deflections are a small fraction of the interior isopycnal vertical displacements and are dependent directly upon the in situ stratification. Conversion of surface height to interior amplitudes and energies encounters significant spatial and seasonal shifts that need to be accounted for in quantitative use. This technical article analyzes the global-scale spatial variations in the relationship between surface deflections and interior motions. Similar considerations make it possible to use altimetric data to estimate the deep interior temperature variability as a function of position, calculations having a strong influence on abyssal trend determination in the presence of eddies.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Past and Future Ocean Circulation from a Contemporary Perspective</title><secondary-title>Ocean Circulation: Mechanisms and Impacts—Past and Future Changes of Meridional Overturning</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Circulation: Mechanisms and Impacts—Past and Future Changes of Meridional Overturning</full-title></periodical><pages>53-74</pages><keywords><keyword>Meridional overturning circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>American Geophysical Union</publisher><isbn>9781118666241</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/173GM06</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2013: The Past and Future Ocean Circulation from a Contemporary Perspective.

Apart from a weak increasing trend at high northern latitudes, the AMOC appears statistically stable over the last 19 yr with fluctuations indistinguishable from those of a stationary Gaussian stochastic process. This characterization makes it possible to study (using highly developed tools) extreme values, predictability, and the statistical significance of apparent trends. Gaussian behavior is consistent with the central limit theorem for a process arising from numerous independent disturbances. In this case, generators include internal instabilities, changes in wind and buoyancy forcing fields, boundary waves, the Gulf Stream and deep western boundary current transports, the interior fraction in Sverdrup balance, and all similar phenomena arriving as summation effects from long distances and times. As a zonal integral through the sum of the large variety of physical processes in the three-dimensional ocean circulation, understanding of the AMOC, if it is of central climate importance, requires breaking it down into its unintegrated components over the entire basin.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Schmitt, Raymond W</author><author>Baker, D James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate change as an intergenerational problem</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>4435-4436</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1302536110</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., R.

The simulations show turbulent upwelling and spreading of the freshwater-laden plume along the ice face and the vigorous melting of ice at rates of meters per day. The simulated August 2010 melt rate of 2.00.3m/d is within uncertainties of the melt rate of 3.01.0m/d calculated from oceanographic data. Melting is greatest at depth, above the subglacial channels, causing glacier undercutting. Melt rates increase proportionally to thermal forcing raised to the power of 1.2-1.6 and to subglacial water flux raised to the power of 0.5-0.9. Therefore, in a warmer climate, Store Glacier melting by ocean may increase from both increased ocean temperature and subglacial discharge.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhai, Xiaoming</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Variability of Wind Power Input to the Oceans with a Focus on the Subpolar North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3892-3903</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Ocean circulation,Wind stress,North Atlantic Oscil</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00472.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhai, X., and C.

This trend is interpreted as a spurious result of the changing observational system. Focusing therefore on the North Atlantic Ocean, where the database is somewhat more secure, it is found that the input power in the subpolar North Atlantic varies significantly in time, showing a strong relationship to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). During positive NAO index years, power input is greater owing to enhanced synoptic activity. Furthermore, cumulative power input to the subpolar North Atlantic is found to correlate significantly with both the eddy kinetic energy there and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), although the physical mechanism at work remains unclear. The assumption that the changing ocean can be neglected relative to the changing atmosphere in calculating the power input is found to be a usefully accurate approximation over the two decades for which changing ocean state estimates are available. Strong dependence on synoptic weather systems of monthly-mean stress distributions implies that past and future climate simulations must account properly for changes in weather systems, not just the large-scale variations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soto-Navarro, F Javier</author><author>Criado-Aldeanueva, Francisco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Model Thermohaline Trends in the Mediterranean Sea during the Last Years: A Change with Respect to the Last Decades?</title><secondary-title>The Scientific World Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Scientific World Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>8</pages><volume>2012</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1100/2012/365698</electronic-resource-num><notes>Soto-Navarro, F.

We introduce a scalar damage variable that quantifies the loss of load-bearing surface area due to fractures and that feeds back with ice viscosity to represent fracture-induced softening. The calving law is a standard failure criterion for viscous damaging materials and represents a macroscopic brittle instability quantified by a critical or threshold damage. We constrain this threshold using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) by inverting for damage on the Larsen B ice shelf prior to its 2002 collapse. By analyzing the damage distribution in areas that subsequently calved, we conclude that calving occurs after fractures have reduced the load-bearing capacity of the ice by 60 ± 10%.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Condron, Alan</author><author>Winsor, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meltwater routing and the Younger Dryas</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>19928-19933</pages><volume>109</volume><issue>49</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1207381109</electronic-resource-num><notes>Condron, A., and P.

The prevailing hypothesis, proposed by Broecker et al. [1989 Nature 341:318–321] more than two decades ago, suggests that an abrupt rerouting of Lake Agassiz overflow through the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Valley inhibited deep water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic and weakened the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). More recently, Tarasov and Peltier [2005 Nature 435:662–665] showed that meltwater could have discharged into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie Valley ∼4,000 km northwest of the St. Lawrence outlet. Here we use a sophisticated, high-resolution, ocean sea-ice model to study the delivery of meltwater from the two drainage outlets to the deep water formation regions in the North Atlantic. Unlike the hypothesis of Broecker et al., freshwater from the St. Lawrence Valley advects into the subtropical gyre ∼3,000 km south of the North Atlantic deep water formation regions and weakens the AMOC by &lt;15%. In contrast, narrow coastal boundary currents efficiently deliver meltwater from the Mackenzie Valley to the deep water formation regions of the subpolar North Atlantic and weaken the AMOC by &gt;30%. We conclude that meltwater discharge from the Arctic, rather than the St. Lawrence Valley, was more likely to have triggered the Younger Dryas cooling.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Ward, B A</author><author>Monteiro, F</author><author>Follows, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interconnection of nitrogen fixers and iron in the Pacific Ocean: Theory and numerical simulations</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>26</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modelin</keyword><keyword>4815 Ecosystems, structure, dynamics, and modeling</keyword><keyword>4845 Nutrients and nutrient cycling</keyword><keyword>4855 Phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>biogeographical provinces</keyword><keyword>iron cycle</keyword><keyword>marine nitrogen fixers</keyword><keyword>nitrogen cycle</keyword><keyword>resource competition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GB004039</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dutkiewicz, S., B.

We present a theoretical framework which considers the competition for iron and nitrogen resources between phytoplankton to explain where nitrogen fixing autotrophs (diazotrophs, which require higher iron quotas, and have slower maximum growth) can co-exist with other phytoplankton. The framework also indicates that iron and fixed nitrogen concentrations can be strongly controlled by the local phytoplankton community. Together with results from a three-dimensional numerical model, we characterize three distinct biogeochemical provinces: 1) where iron supply is very low diazotrophs are excluded, and iron-limited nondiazotrophic phytoplankton control the iron concentrations; 2) a transition region where nondiazotrophic phytoplankton are nitrogen limited and control the nitrogen concentrations, but the iron supply is still too low relative to nitrate to support diazotrophy; 3) where iron supplies increase further relative to the nitrogen source, diazotrophs and other phytoplankton coexist; nitrogen concentrations are controlled by nondiazotrophs and iron concentrations are controlled by diazotrophs. The boundaries of these three provinces are defined by the rate of supply of iron relative to the supply of fixed nitrogen. The numerical model and theory provide a useful tool to understand the state of, links between, and response to changes in iron supply and phytoplankton community structure that have been suggested by observations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Feng, W</author><author>Zhong, M</author><author>Xu, H Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sea level variations in the South China Sea inferred from satellite gravity, altimetry, and oceanographic data</title><secondary-title>Science China-Earth Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science China-Earth Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1696-1701</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>annual cycle</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>inference</keyword><keyword>mass</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>sea level variation</keyword><keyword>surface height</keyword><keyword>the South China Sea</keyword><keyword>topex/poseidon</keyword><keyword>trends</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11430-012-4394-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Feng, W., M.

These two components of SLV in the South China Sea (SCS) are studied by using satellite altimetry, GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite gravity, and oceanographic data on annual and inter-annual timescales. On the annual timescale, the geographic distribution of mass-induced SLV's amplitude jointly estimated from altimetry and the ECCO (Estimation of the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) model agrees very well with that from GRACE. GRACE observes obvious seasonal mass-induced SLV in the SCS with annual amplitude of 2.7 +/- 0.4 cm, which is consistent with the annual amplitude of 2.7 +/- 0.3 cm estimated from the steric-corrected altimetry. On the inter-annual timescales, the mean SLV in the SCS shows a large oscillation, which is mainly caused by the steric effect. The trend of mean SLV inferred from altimetry in the SCS is 5.5 +/- 0.7 mm/yr for the period of 1993-2009, which is significantly higher than the global sea level rise rate of 3.3 +/- 0.4 mm/yr in the same period. There is no obvious trend signal in the mass-induced SLV detected from GRACE that indicates the water exchange between the SCS and its adjacent seas and land is in balance within the study period.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Granskog, Mats A</author><author>Stedmon, Colin A</author><author>Dodd, Paul A</author><author>Amon, Rainer M W</author><author>Pavlov, Alexey K</author><author>de Steur, Laura</author><author>Hansen, Edmond</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Arctic outflow in the Fram Strait: Assessing the changes and fate of terrigenous CDOM in the Arctic Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modelin</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>4808 Chemical tracers</keyword><keyword>9315 Arctic region</keyword><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>Fram Strait</keyword><keyword>absorption coefficient</keyword><keyword>chromophoric dissolved organic matter</keyword><keyword>river water</keyword><keyword>spectral slope coefficient</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012JC008075</electronic-resource-num><notes>Granskog, M.

A pronounced CDOM absorption maximum between 30 and 120 m depth was associated with river and sea ice brine enriched water, characteristic of the Arctic mixed layer and upper halocline waters in the East Greenland Current (EGC). The lowest CDOM concentrations were found in the Atlantic inflow. We show that the salinity-CDOM relationship is not suitable for evaluating conservative mixing of CDOM. The strong correlation between meteoric water and CDOM is indicative of the riverine/terrigenous origin of CDOM in the EGC. Based on CDOM absorption in Polar Water and comparison with an Arctic river discharge weighted mean, we estimate that a 49–59% integrated loss of CDOM absorption across 250–600 nm has occurred. A preferential removal of absorption at longer wavelengths reflects the loss of high molecular weight material. In contrast, CDOM fluxes through the Fram Strait using September velocity fields from a high-resolution ocean–sea ice model indicate that the net southward transport of terrigenous CDOM through the Fram Strait equals up to 50% of the total riverine CDOM input; this suggests that the Fram Strait export is a major sink of CDOM. These contrasting results indicate that we have to constrain the (C)DOM budgets for the Arctic Ocean much better and examine uncertainties related to using tracers to assess conservative mixing in polar waters.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Graven, H D</author><author>Gruber, N</author><author>Key, R</author><author>Khatiwala, S</author><author>Giraud, X</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changing controls on oceanic radiocarbon: New insights on shallow-to-deep ocean exchange and anthropogenic CO2 uptake</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><keywords><keyword>atlantic-ocean</keyword><keyword>carbon-cycle</keyword><keyword>gas-exchange</keyword><keyword>indian-ocean</keyword><keyword>north pacific</keyword><keyword>northwestern pacific</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>recent climate-change</keyword><keyword>resolution coral record</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012jc008074</electronic-resource-num><notes>Graven, H.

While the oceanic uptake of bomb-derived C-14 was primarily controlled by air-sea exchange in the early decades after the bomb spike, we demonstrate that changes in oceanic C-14 are now primarily controlled by shallow-to-deep ocean exchange, i.e., the same mechanism that governs anthropogenic CO2 uptake. This is a result of accumulated bomb C-14 uptake that has rapidly decreased the air-sea gradient of C-14/C (Delta C-14) and shifted the main reservoir of bomb C-14 from the atmosphere to the upper ocean. The air-sea Delta C-14 gradient, reduced further by fossil fuel dilution, is now weaker than before weapons testing in most regions. Oceanic C-14, and particularly its temporal change, can now be used to study the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. We examine observed changes in oceanic Delta C-14 between the WOCE/SAVE (1988-1995) and the CLIVAR (2001-2007) eras and simulations with two ocean general circulation models, the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) and the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Model (ECCO). Observed oceanic Delta C-14 and its changes between the 1980s-90s and 2000s indicate that shallow-to-deep exchange is too efficient in ECCO and too sluggish in CCSM. These findings suggest that mean global oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 between 1990 and 2007 is bounded by the ECCO-based estimate of 2.3 Pg C yr(-1) and the CCSM-based estimate of 1.7 Pg C yr(-1)</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Losch, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adjoint sensitivities of sub-ice-shelf melt rates to ocean circulation under the Pine Island Ice Shelf, West Antarctica</title><secondary-title>Annals of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>59-69</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>60</issue><keywords><keyword>assimilation</keyword><keyword>basal</keyword><keyword>bottom topography</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>glacier</keyword><keyword>greenland</keyword><keyword>grounding line</keyword><keyword>meteorological observations</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/2012/AoG60A025</electronic-resource-num><notes>Heimbach, P., and M.

The adjoint code is based on algorithmic differentiation (AD) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's ocean general circulation model (MITgcm). The adjoint model was extended by adding into the AD process the corresponding sub-ice-shelf cavity code, which implements a three-equation thermodynamic melt-rate parameterization to infer heat and freshwater fluxes at the ice-shelf/ocean boundary. The inferred sensitivities reveal dominant timescales of 30 60 days over which the shelf exit is connected to the deep interior via advective processes. They exhibit rich three-dimensional time-evolving patterns that can be understood in terms of a combination of the buoyancy forcing by inflowing water masses, the cavity geometry and the effect of rotation and topography in steering the flow in the presence of prominent features in the bedrock bathymetry. Dominant sensitivity pathways are found over a sill, as well as 'shadow regions' of very low sensitivities. To the extent that these transient patterns are robust they carry important information for decision-making in observation deployment and monitoring.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decadal ocean (and ice) state estimation for climate research: What are the needs?</title><secondary-title>Oberwolfach Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oberwolfach Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>3451-3454</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4171/OWR/2012/58</electronic-resource-num><notes>Heimbach, P., and C.

It is demonstrated that tracer advection schemes developed by Prather and collaborators for application in the stratosphere, greatly improve the fidelity of eddying flows, reducing levels of spurious diapycnal mixing to below those directly measured in field experiments, similar to 1 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1). This approach yields a model in which geostrophic eddies are quasi-adiabatic in the ocean interior, so that the residual-mean overturning circulation aligns almost perfectly with density contours. A reentrant channel configuration of the MIT General Circulation Model, that approximates the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, is used to examine these issues. Virtual analogs of ocean deliberate tracer release field experiments reinforce our conclusion, producing passive tracer solutions that parallel field experiments remarkably well.

The transport is found to be sensitive to wind stress perturbations both along the ACC path and also in remote regions. The time scale of influence of wind stress perturbations is on the order of 100 days. Regarding spatial scales, the sensitivity of transport to wind stress is relatively smooth in regions of flat topography. In boundary regions and regions with complex topography, however, the sensitivity is enhanced and characterized by shorter length scales of order 100 km. Positive perturbations to the zonal wind stress usually increase the ACC transport, though the wind stress curl is of primary influence where the currents are steered by topography. Highlighting locations where the ACC is especially responsive to air-sea momentum fluxes reveals where an accurate determination of atmospheric winds may best enhance ocean modeling efforts.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marcus, S L</author><author>Dickey, J O</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>de Viron, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detection of the Earth rotation response to a rapid fluctuation of Southern Ocean circulation in November 2009</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>39</volume><keywords><keyword>length</keyword><keyword>of-day variations</keyword><keyword>signals</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011gl050671</electronic-resource-num><notes>Marcus, S.

While atmospheric effects dominate changes in the Earth's rate of rotation and hence length-of-day (LOD) on these time scales, the addition of oceanic angular momentum (OAM) estimates has been shown to improve closure of the LOD budget in a statistical sense. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the signature of a specific, sub-monthly ocean current fluctuation on the Earth's rotation rate, coinciding with recently-reported anomalies which developed in southeast Pacific surface temperature and bottom pressure fields during late 2009. Our results show that concurrent variations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which saw a sharp drop and recovery in zonal transport during a two-week period in November, were strong enough to cause a detectable change in LOD following the removal of atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) computed from the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) database. The strong OAM variations driving the LOD-AAM changes were diagnosed from ocean state estimates of the Consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) and involved roughly equal contributions from the current and pressure terms, with in situ confirmation for the latter provided by tide-corrected bottom pressure recorder data from the South Drake Passage site of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current Levels by Altimetry and Island Measurements (ACCLAIM) network.

Additionally, Glacial Southern Source Bottom Water (GSSBW) was saltier than Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), over and above the difference implied by the mean sea level change. This study examines to what extent cold temperatures, through their effect on ice formation and melting, could have caused these differences. Computational sensitivity experiments using a coupled ice shelf cavity–sea ice–ocean model are performed in a Weddell Sea domain, as a representative case study for bottom water formation originating from Antarctic continental shelves. Ocean temperatures at the domain open boundaries are systematically lowered to determine the sensitivity of Weddell Sea water mass properties to a range of cool ocean temperatures. The steady state salinities differ between experiments due to temperature-induced responses of ice shelf and sea ice melting and freezing, evaporation and open boundary fluxes. The results of the experiments indicate that reduced ocean temperature can explain up to 30% of the salinity difference between GSSBW and AABW, primarily due to decreased ice shelf melting. The smallest and most exposed ice shelves, which abut narrow continental shelves, have the greatest sensitivity to the ocean temperature changes, suggesting that at the LGM there could have been a shift in geographical site dominance in bottom water formation. More sea ice is formed and exported in the cold ocean experiments, but the effect of this on salinity is negated by an equal magnitude reduction in evaporation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nastula, J</author><author>Gross, R</author><author>Salstein, D A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic excitation of polar motion: Identification of specific oceanic areas important for polar motion excitation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>16-23</pages><volume>62</volume><keywords><keyword>Non-atmospheric excitation</keyword><keyword>Oceanic excitation</keyword><keyword>atmospheric angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>chandler-wobble</keyword><keyword>earth</keyword><keyword>models</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jog.2012.01.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nastula, J., R.

The influence of different geographic regions of the ocean on the excitation of polar motion is determined by calculating correlations and covariances between these regional excitations and either the global non-atmospheric excitation or the global oceanic excitation. The non-atmospheric excitation is estimated by subtracting the atmospheric signal from the excitation computed from geodetic observations of polar motion; the global oceanic excitation function is equivalent to the sum of the oceanic excitation function computed in every grid point. Our attention focuses on the regional distribution of the oceanic polar motion excitation for two time scales: the seasonal spectral band and the band around the Chandler period. We identified the southern Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean as important regions for non-atmospheric polar motion excitation. The maximum of variability over the southern Indian Ocean is especially important in the case of annual oscillation. The Atlantic Ocean makes less significant contribution to the non-atmospheric polar motion excitation than the Pacific and Indian Ocean in both considered spectral ranges. Inland seas like the Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan have high covariance with the global signals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Two 1992-2008 data-constrained solutions at 9- and 4-km horizontal grid spacing show that 1) winter sea ice growth results in brine rejection and DW formation; 2) the DW flows primarily down Barrow and Central-Herald Canyons in the form of bottom-trapped, intermittent currents to depths of 50-150 m from the late winter to late summer seasons; and 3) eddies with diameters similar to 30 km carry the cold DW from the shelf break into the Canada Basin interior at depths of 50-150 m. The 4-km data-constrained solution does not show eddy transport across the Chukchi Shelf at shallow depths; instead, advection of DW downstream of polynya regions is driven by a strong (similar to 0.1 m s(-1)) mean current on the Chukchi Shelf. Upper halocline water (UHW) formation rate was obtained from two methods: one is based on satellite data and on a simple parameterized approach, and the other is computed from the authors' model solution. The two methods yield 5740 +/- 61420 km(3) yr(-1) and 4190-4860 +/- 61440 km(3) yr(-1), respectively. These rates imply a halocline replenishment period of 10-21 yr. Passive tracers also show that water with highest density forms in the Gulf of Anadyr and along the eastern Siberian coast immediately north of the Bering Strait. These results provide a coherent picture of the seasonal development of UHW at high spatial and temporal resolutions and serve as a guide for improving understanding of water-mass formation in the western Arctic Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Importance of Circulation Changes to Atlantic Heat Storage Rates on Seasonal and Interannual Time Scales</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>350-362</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Atlantic Ocean,Energy transport,Meridional overtur</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00123.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

The focus is on low- and midlatitude regions and on seasonal and interannual time scales. An estimate of the ocean state over 1993–2004, produced by a coarse-resolution general circulation model fit to observations via the method of Lagrange multipliers, is used. Meridional heat transports are first decomposed into contributions from time-mean and time-variable velocity and temperature and second from zonally symmetric baroclinic (overturning, including Ekman) and zonally asymmetric (gyre and other spatially correlated) circulations. Heat storage rates are then ascribed to ocean–atmosphere heat exchanges, diffusive mixing, and advective processes related to the various components of the meridional heat transport. Results show that seasonal heat storage changes generally represent a local response to surface heat inputs, but seasonal advective changes are also important near the equator. Interannual heat storage rate anomalies are mostly due to advection in tropical regions, whereas both surface heat fluxes and advection contribute at higher latitudes. Low-latitude advection can be primarily attributed to zonally symmetric baroclinic circulations, but temperature variations and zonally asymmetric flows can contribute elsewhere. A relationship between interannual heat storage rates in the equatorial Atlantic’s top 100 m and meridional heat transport associated with the zonally symmetric baroclinic flow is observed; however, due in part to the role of shallow advective processes at these latitudes, any direct relationship between sea surface temperature variability and heat transport changes associated with intermediate or deep meridional overturning circulations is not clear.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Buoyancy-driven interannual sea level changes in the southeast tropical Pacific</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>39</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>1641 Sea level change</keyword><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>buoyancy forcing</keyword><keyword>ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>regional sea level variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012GL051130</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

This view is based in part on modeling studies of wind-driven sea level changes along the tropical Pacific. However, because buoyancy forcing (and other generating mechanisms) are usually ignored, this paradigm may overemphasize the role of winds. Focusing on the southeast tropical Pacific, we use a data-constrained ocean state estimate to demonstrate that distinct mechanisms—including the ocean's response to buoyancy forcing as well as nonlinear processes—can also contribute to interannual sea level variability. Contrary to the notion that buoyancy-driven sea level changes are dynamically passive, such changes exhibit a strongly nonlocal, dynamically active character, made manifest in westward propagating waves. As similar findings apply elsewhere, accurate modeling of interannual-to-decadal regional sea level changes requires consideration of a variety of forcing mechanisms, including, but not limited to, the winds.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An assessment of deep steric height variability over the global ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>39</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>deep ocean</keyword><keyword>steric height</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GL050681</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

Results are based on monthly-averaged steric height anomalies, vertically integrated over the “unobserved” deep ocean (below ∼1700 m). Excluding linear trends, variability in deep steric height is typically 10–20% of that in the upper ocean, with larger values seen in extensive regions. Enhanced deep variability, at monthly to interannual time scales, occurs in areas of strong eddy energy. Deep signals are mostly thermosteric in nature, with halosteric contributions tightly correlated and generally compensating in the Atlantic and Indian oceans and adding in the Pacific. Potential inference of deep signals from knowledge of the upper ocean is hampered by poor correlations, and regressions based on upper ocean steric height fail to represent the estimated deep variability. Monthly sampling at ∼2° scales would allow for best determination of deep variability and long term trends.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Fenty, I</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Xu, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spreading of warm ocean waters around Greenland as a possible cause for glacier acceleration</title><secondary-title>Annals of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>257-266</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>60</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/2012AoG60A136</electronic-resource-num><notes>Rignot, E., I.

The simulation, provided by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2) project, qualitatively reproduces the observed warming of subsurface waters in the subpolar gyre associated with changes of the North Atlantic atmospheric state that occurred in the mid-1990s. The modeled subsurface ocean temperature warmed by 1.5°C in southeast and southwest Greenland during 1994-2005 and subsequently cooled by 0.5°C; modeled subsurface ocean temperature increased by 2-2.5°C in central and then northwest Greenland during 1997-2005 and stabilized thereafter, while it increased after 2005 by &lt;0.5°C in north Greenland. Comparisons with in situ measurements off the continental shelf in the Labrador and Irminger Seas indicate that the model initial conditions were 0.4°C too warm in the south but the simulated warming is correctly reproduced; while measurements from eastern Baffin Bay reveal that the model initial conditions were 1.0°C too cold in the northwest but the simulated ocean warming brought modeled temperature closer to observations, i.e. the simulated warming is 1.0°C too large. At several key locations, the modeled oceanic changes off the shelf and below the seasonal mixed layer were rapidly transmitted to the shelf within troughs towards (model-unresolved) fjords. Unless blocked in the fjords by shallow sills, these warm subsurface waters had potential to propagate down the fjords and melt the glacier fronts. Based on model sensitivity simulations from an independent study (Xu and others, 2012), we show that the oceanic changes have very likely increased the subaqueous melt rates of the glacier fronts, and in turn impacted the rates of glacier flow.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prowe, A E Friederike</author><author>Pahlow, Markus</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael</author><author>Oschlies, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Top-down control of marine phytoplankton diversity in a global ecosystem model</title><secondary-title>Progress in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Progress in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>101</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pocean.2011.11.016</electronic-resource-num><notes>Prowe, A.

Realizing that biodiversity might influence the adaptation potential, recent model approaches have identified bottom-up controls on patterns of phytoplankton diversity regulated by nutrient availability and seasonality. Top-down control of biodiversity, however, has not been considered in depth in such models. Here we demonstrate how zooplankton predation with prey-ratio based food preferences can enhance phytoplankton diversity in a ecosystem-circulation model with self-assembling community structure. Simulated diversity increases more than threefold under preferential grazing relative to standard density-dependent predation, and yields better agreement with observed distributions of phytoplankton diversity. The variable grazing pressure creates refuges for less competitive phytoplankton types, which reduces exclusion and improves the representation of seasonal phytoplankton succession during blooms. The type of grazing parameterization also has a significant impact on primary and net community production. Our results demonstrate how a simple parameterization of a zooplankton community response affects simulated phytoplankton community structure, diversity and dynamics, and motivates development of more detailed representations of top-down processes essential for investigating the role of diversity in marine ecosystems.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanchez-Reales, J M</author><author>Vigo, M I</author><author>Jin, S</author><author>Chao, B F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Surface Geostrophic Ocean Currents Derived from Satellite Altimetry and GOCE Geoid</title><secondary-title>Marine Geodesy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine Geodesy</full-title></periodical><pages>175-189</pages><volume>35</volume><keywords><keyword>GOCE</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>drifters</keyword><keyword>geostrophic currents</keyword><keyword>jet</keyword><keyword>mean dynamic topography</keyword><keyword>mission</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean dynamic topography</keyword><keyword>recovery</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific</keyword><keyword>velocity</keyword><keyword>wind</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01490419.2012.718696</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sanchez-Reales, J.

Here we calculate the Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) by subtracting the geoid height determined by the GOCE satellite mission from the Mean Sea Surface Topography (MSST) derived from multi-satellite ocean altimetry (T/P, Jason 1/2, ERS-1/2, GEOSAT).

We found GOCE-based geoid solution clearly leads to significant improvements in the spatial resolution of SGC globally except in the Equatorial band where special filtering may be needed, with current velocities and spatial patterns closest to the in situ measurements of currents, compared with the GRACE-based results or ECCO model simulations that give significantly weaker Values with lower spatial resolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schodlok, M P</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Studinger, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sensitivity of the ice-shelf/ocean system to the sub-ice-shelf cavity shape measured by NASA Ice Bridge in Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica</title><secondary-title>Annals of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>156-162</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>60</issue><keywords><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>beneath</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>thickness</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/2012AoG60A073</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schodlok, M.

The first simulation uses BEDMAP bathymetry under the Pine Island ice shelf, and the second simulation uses NASA Ice Bridge-derived bathymetry. The Ice Bridge data reveal the existence of a trough from the ice-shelf edge to the grounding line, enabling warm Circumpolar Deep Water to penetrate to the grounding line, leading to higher melt rates than previously estimated. The mean melt rate for the simulation with NASA Ice Bridge data is 28 m a(-1), much higher than previous model estimates but closer to estimates from remote sensing. Although the mean melt rate is 25% higher than in the simulation with BEDMAP bathymetry, the temporal evolution remains unchanged between the two simulations. This indicates that temporal variability of melting is mostly driven by processes outside the cavity. Spatial melt rate patterns of BEDMAP and IceBridge simulations differ significantly, with the latter in closer agreement with satellite-derived melt rate estimates of similar to 50 m a(-1) near the grounding line. Our simulations confirm that knowledge of the cavity shape and its time evolution are essential to accurately capture basal mass loss of Antarctic ice shelves.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Dam, T</author><author>Collilieux, X</author><author>Wuite, J</author><author>Altamimi, Z</author><author>Ray, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nontidal ocean loading: amplitudes and potential effects in GPS height time series</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodesy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodesy</full-title></periodical><pages>1043-1057</pages><volume>86</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Annual signals</keyword><keyword>Height coordinate time series</keyword><keyword>Loading effects</keyword><keyword>Ocean bottom pressure</keyword><keyword>deformation</keyword><keyword>displacements</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>region</keyword><keyword>solid earth</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00190-012-0564-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>van Dam, T., X.

The only previous global analysis investigating the magnitude of OBP surface displacements used older OBP data sets (van Dam et al. in J Geophys Res 129:507-517, 1997). Since then significant improvements in meteorological forcing models used to predict OBP have been made, augmented by observations from satellite altimetry and expendable bathythermograph profiles. Using more recent OBP estimates from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) project, we reassess the amplitude of the predicted effect of OBP on the height coordinate time series from a global distribution of GPS stations. OBP-predicted loading effects display an RMS scatter in the height of between 0.2 and 3.7 mm, larger than previously reported but still much smaller (by a factor of 2) than the scatter observed due to atmospheric pressure loading. Given the improvement in GPS hardware and data analysis techniques, the OBP signal is similar to the precision of weekly GPS height coordinates. We estimate the effect of OBP on GPS height coordinate time series using the MIT reprocessed solution, mi1. When we compare the predicted OBP height time series with mi1, we find that the scatter is reduced over all stations by 0.1 mm on average with reductions as high as 0.7 mm at some stations. More importantly we are able to reduce the scatter on 65 % of the stations investigated. The annual component of the OBP signal is responsible for 80 % of the reduction in scatter on average. We find that stations located close to semi-enclosed bays or seas are affected by OBP loading to a greater extent than other stations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tank, Suzanne E</author><author>Manizza, Manfredi</author><author>Holmes, Robert Max</author><author>McClelland, James W</author><author>Peterson, Bruce J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Processing and Impact of Dissolved Riverine Nitrogen in the Arctic Ocean</title><secondary-title>Estuaries and Coasts</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Estuaries and Coasts</full-title></periodical><pages>401-415</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12237-011-9417-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tank, S.

This study couples estimates of circumpolar riverine nutrient fluxes from the PARTNERS (Pan-Arctic River Transport of Nutrients, Organic Matter, and Suspended Sediments) Project with a regionally configured version of the MIT general circulation model to develop estimates of the distribution and availability of dissolved riverine N in the Arctic Ocean, assess its importance for primary production, and compare these estimates to potential bacterial production fueled by riverine C. Because riverine dissolved organic nitrogen is remineralized slowly, riverine N is available for uptake well into the open ocean. Despite this, we estimate that even when recycling is considered, riverine N may support 0.5–1.5 Tmol C year−1 of primary production, a small proportion of total Arctic Ocean photosynthesis. Rapid uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen coupled with relatively high rates of dissolved organic nitrogen regeneration in N-limited nearshore regions, however, leads to potential localized rates of riverine-supported photosynthesis that represent a substantial proportion of nearshore production.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L</author><author>Pujol, M Isabelle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quality assessment of a satellite altimetry data product in the Nordic, Barents, and Kara seas</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4275 Remote sensing and electromagnetic processes</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>Arctic seas</keyword><keyword>Nordic seas</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword><keyword>surface drifters</keyword><keyword>tide gauges</keyword><keyword>validation of altimetry data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC007557</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

However, the high-latitude regions have traditionally been avoided due to the persistent sea ice cover. Most of the validation studies have focused on the areas below the polar circles. In this paper we examine the quality and performance of a gridded satellite altimetry product in the Nordic, Barents, and Kara seas. The altimetric sea level in coastal areas is validated using available tide gauge records. We show that at most locations in the Nordic seas the altimetry and tide gauge measurements are in a good agreement in terms of the root-mean square differences and the amplitudes and phases of the seasonal cycle. The agreement deteriorates in the shallow areas of the Barents and Kara seas subject to the seasonal presence of sea ice, and where the altimetry data are contaminated by the residual aliasing of unresolved high-frequency signals. The comparison of linear trends at the locations of tide gauges reveals discrepancies that need to be taken into account when interpreting long-term changes of sea level in the region. Away from the coast the altimetry data are compared to drifter trajectories, corrected for Ekman currents. The drifter trajectories are found consistent with the mesoscale variability of the altimetric sea level. This study provides the first comprehensive validation of a gridded satellite altimetry data product in the high-latitude seas.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L</author><author>Zlotnicki, Victor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performance of GOCE and GRACE-derived mean dynamic topographies in resolving Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts</title><secondary-title>Ocean Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>893-905</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10236-012-0541-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

The mean dynamic topography (MDT) is the difference between the time-averaged sea surface height and the geoid. The GOCE mission is aimed at determining the geoid with superior accuracy and spatial resolution, so that a more accurate MDT can be estimated. In this study, we determine the mean positions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts using the purely geodetic estimates of the MDT constructed from an altimetric mean sea surface and GOCE and GRACE geoids. Overall, the frontal positions obtained from the GOCE and GRACE MDTs are close to each other. This means that these independent estimates are robust and can potentially be used to validate frontal positions obtained from sparse and irregular in situ measurements. The geodetic frontal positions are compared to earlier estimates as well as to those derived from MDTs based on satellite and in situ measurements and those obtained from an ocean data synthesis product. The position of the Sub-Antarctic Front identified in the GOCE MDT is found to be in better agreement with the previous estimates than that identified in the GRACE MDT. The geostrophic velocities derived from the GOCE MDT are also closer to observations than those derived from the GRACE MDT. Our results thus show that the GOCE mission represents an improvement upon GRACE in terms of the time-averaged geoid.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ward, B A</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Jahn, O</author><author>Follows, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A size-structured food-web model for the global ocean</title><secondary-title>Limnology and Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Limnology and Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1877-1891</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4319/lo.2012.57.6.1877</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ward, B.

Physiological and ecological traits of the organisms are constrained by relationships with cell size. The model qualitatively reproduces global distributions of nutrients, biomass, and primary productivity, and captures the power-law relationship between cell size and numerical density, which has realistic slopes of between −1.3 and −0.8. We use the model to explore the global structure of marine ecosystems, highlighting the importance of both nutrient and grazer controls. The model suggests that zooplankton : phytoplankton (Z : P) biomass ratios may vary from an order of 0.1 in the oligotrophic gyres to an order of 10 in upwelling and high-latitude regions. Global estimates of the strength of bottom-up and top-down controls within plankton size classes suggest that these large-scale gradients in Z : P ratios are driven by a shift from strong bottom-up, nutrient limitation in the oligotrophic gyres to the dominance of top-down, grazing controls in more productive regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Y</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Koppes, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Numerical experiments on subaqueous melting of Greenland tidewater glaciers in response to ocean warming and enhanced subglacial discharge</title><secondary-title>Annals of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>229-234</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>60</issue><keywords><keyword>alaska</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>fjord</keyword><keyword>ice shelf</keyword><keyword>runoff</keyword><keyword>sheet</keyword><keyword>terminus</keyword><keyword>waters</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/2012AoG60A139</electronic-resource-num><notes>Xu, Y., E.

Studies of ice-sheet/ocean interactions have mostly focused on melting beneath near-horizontal floating ice shelves. For tidewater glaciers, melting instead takes place along the vertical face of the calving front. Here we modify the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) to include ice melting from a calving face with the freshwater outflow at the glacier grounding line. We use the model to predict melt rates and their sensitivity to ocean thermal forcing and to subglacial discharge. We find that melt rates increase with approximately the one-third power of the subglacial water flux, and increase linearly with ocean thermal forcing. Our simulations indicate that, consistent with limited field data, melting ceases when subglacial discharge is shut off, and reaches several meters per day when subglacial discharge is high in the summer. These results are a first step toward a more realistic representation of subglacial discharge and of ocean thermal forcing on the subaqueous melting of tidewater glaciers in a numerical ocean model. Our results illustrate that the ice-front melting process is both complex and strongly time-dependent.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yan, Y F</author><author>Xu, D Z</author><author>Qi, Y Q</author><author>Gan, Z J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observations of Freshening in the Northwest Pacific Subtropical Gyre near Luzon Strait</title><secondary-title>Atmosphere-Ocean</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Atmosphere-Ocean</full-title></periodical><pages>92-102</pages><volume>50</volume><keywords><keyword>Argo</keyword><keyword>Northwest Pacific</keyword><keyword>barrier layer</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>freshening</keyword><keyword>interannual variations</keyword><keyword>mixed-layer</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>precipitation</keyword><keyword>sea-surface salinity</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific</keyword><keyword>upper ocean</keyword><keyword>western equatorial pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07055900.2012.715078</electronic-resource-num><notes>Yan, Y.

Such freshening is also found in the outputs of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model. The possible mechanisms for the freshening are investigated using the surface freshwater flux (E-P) data, the ECCO outputs and a salt budget equation for the upper ocean. Our analysis indicates that the magnitude of the salinity change caused by the surface freshwater flux anomaly is far smaller than observed, suggesting that the surface freshwater flux anomaly is not sufficient to account for the observed freshening. In fact, the salinity anomaly is closely linked to a pronounced freshening at the northeast corner of the study area from 2003 to 2007. The advection of salinity anomalies in the western North Pacific Ocean between 25 degrees N and 35 degrees N via a southwestward flow in the &quot;C-shaped&quot; region associated with the Kuroshio system is the main mechanism responsible for the observed freshening in the study area.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zanna, L</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Moore, A M</author><author>Tziperman, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Upper-ocean singular vectors of the North Atlantic climate with implications for linear predictability and variability</title><secondary-title>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>500-513</pages><volume>138</volume><issue>663</issue><keywords><keyword>decadal prediction</keyword><keyword>error growth</keyword><keyword>heat content</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>model initialization</keyword><keyword>optimal perturbations</keyword><keyword>sensitivity analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/qj.937</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zanna, L., P.

Singular vectors (optimal perturbations) are calculated using the GCM, its tangent linear and adjoint models to determine an upper bound on the predictability of North Atlantic climate. The maximum growth time-scales of MOC and upper-ocean temperature anomalies, excited by the singular vectors, are 18.5 and 13 years respectively and in part explained by the westward propagation of upper-ocean anomalies against the mean flow. As a result of the linear interference of non-orthogonal eigenmodes of the non-normal dynamics, the ocean dynamics are found to actively participate in the significant growth of the anomalies. An initial density perturbation of merely 0.02 kg m−3 is found to lead to a 1.7 Sv MOC anomaly after 18.5 years. In addition, Northern Hemisphere upper-ocean temperature perturbations can be amplified by a factor of 2 after 13 years. The growth of upper-ocean temperature and MOC anomalies is slower and weaker when excited by the upper-ocean singular vectors than when the deep ocean is perturbed. This leads to the conclusion that predictability experiments perturbing only the atmospheric initial state may overestimate the predictability time. Interestingly, optimal MOC and upper-ocean temperature excitations are only weakly correlated, thus limiting the utility of SST observations to infer MOC variability. The excitation of anomalies in this model might have a crucial impact on the variability and predictability of Atlantic climate. The limit of predictability of the MOC is found to be different from that of the upper-ocean heat content, emphasizing that errors in ocean initial conditions will affect various measures differently and such uncertainties should be carefully considered in decadal prediction experiments.

Such mass redistribution produced by SAL effects is shown to be an important component of OBP variability on scales from months to years and to provide for a better description of the OBP annual cycle observed by GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment). The SAL‐induced ocean mass variations have magnitudes comparable to the dynamic OBP signals at subannual, annual, and interannual time scales in many ocean regions and should not be ignored in studies of ocean mass. Annual variations account for the most variability in SAL‐related mass signals and can be induced by all the loads considered, with hydrology having the largest contribution. At subannual and interannual time scales, impact of hydrology is minimal and variations are mostly related to load changes from ocean dynamics and from changes in atmospheric circulation, depending on ocean region. The results demonstrate that the large‐scale SAL effects are not negligible in the analysis
of GRACE‐derived global observations of OBP. The estimated SAL effects can explain on average 0.2 cm2 (16%) of the variance in the GRACE annual cycle (expressed in terms of equivalent water height), exceeding 1 cm2 in both open ocean and coastal regions with strong annual SAL signals.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abernathey, Ryan</author><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Ferreira, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Dependence of Southern Ocean Meridional Overturning on Wind Stress</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2261-2278</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Southern Ocean,Baroclinic flows,Dynamics,Eddies,Ma</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-11-023.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Abernathey, R., J.

Marshall and T. Radko. In addition to wind and buoyancy forcing at the surface, the model contains a sponge layer at the northern boundary that permits a residual meridional overturning circulation (MOC) to exist at depth. The strength of the residual MOC is diagnosed for different strengths of surface wind stress. It is found that the eddy circulation largely compensates for the changes in Ekman circulation. The extent of the compensation and thus the sensitivity of the MOC to the winds depend on the surface boundary condition. A fixed-heat-flux surface boundary severely limits the ability of the MOC to change. An interactive heat flux leads to greater sensitivity. To explain the MOC sensitivity to the wind strength under the interactive heat flux, transformed Eulerian-mean theory is applied, in which the eddy diffusivity plays a central role in determining the eddy response. A scaling theory for the eddy diffusivity, based on the mechanical energy balance, is developed and tested; the average magnitude of the diffusivity is found to be proportional to the square root of the wind stress. The MOC sensitivity to the winds based on this scaling is compared with the true sensitivity diagnosed from the experiments.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aretxabaleta, A L</author><author>Smith, K W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analyzing state-dependent model-data comparison in multi-regime systems</title><secondary-title>Computational Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computational Geosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>627-636</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Data clustering</keyword><keyword>ENSO</keyword><keyword>Gaussian mixture models</keyword><keyword>Skill assessment</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>selection</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>time-series</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10596-011-9229-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Aretxabaleta, A.

We investigated the causes of the Earth's Chandler wobble variability over the past 60 years. Our approach is based on integrating of the atmospheric and oceanic angular momentum computed by global circulation models. We directly compared the result of the integration with the Earth's pole coordinate observed by precise astrometric, space, and geodetic techniques. This approach differs from the traditional approach in which the observed polar motion is transformed into a so-called geodetic excitation function, and compared afterwards with the angular momentum of the external geophysical fluid layers. Methods. In the time domain, we integrated the atmospheric angular momentum time series from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis project and the oceanic angular momentum data from the ECCO consortium. We extracted the Chandler wobble from this modeled polar motion by singular spectrum analysis, and compared it with the Chandler wobble extracted from the observed polar motion given by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service data. Results. We showed that the combination of the atmosphere and the oceans explains most of the observed Chandler wobble variations, and is consistent with results reported in the literature and obtained with the traditional approach. Our approach allows one to appreciate the separate contributions of the atmosphere and the oceans to the various bumps and valleys observed in the Chandler wobble. Though the atmosphere explains the Chandler wobble amplitude variations between 1949 and 1970, the reexcitation of the Chandler wobble that begins in the 1980s, after a minimum around 1970, and that reaches its maximum in the late 1990s is due to the oceans, while the atmospheric contribution remains stable within the same period.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Jones, Helen</author><author>Marshall, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Super-parameterization in ocean modeling: Application to deep convection</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>90-101</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Deep convection</keyword><keyword>Multi-scale modeling</keyword><keyword>Ocean modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2010.10.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Campin, J.-M., C.

The large-scale pattern of SOSE and Large and Yeager turbulent heat flux adjustment is similar, but the magnitude of SOSE adjustments is significantly larger. Their radiative heat flux adjustments patterns differ. Turbulent heat fluxes determined by combining COARE bulk formulas with NCEP1 or ERA should not be combined with unmodified NCEP1 or ERA radiative fluxes as the net ocean heat gain poleward of 25°S becomes unrealistically large. The other surface flux products (i.e., NCEP1, ERA, Large and Yeager, and SOSE) balance more closely.Overall, the statistical estimates of the differences between the various air–sea heat flux products tend to be largest in regions with strong ocean mesoscale activity such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the western boundary currents.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Condron, Alan</author><author>Winsor, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A subtropical fate awaited freshwater discharged from glacial Lake Agassiz</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>1605 Abrupt/rapid climate change</keyword><keyword>3344 Paleoclimatology</keyword><keyword>4528 Fronts and jets</keyword><keyword>4962 Thermohaline</keyword><keyword>5462 Polar regions</keyword><keyword>8.2-kyr-event</keyword><keyword>abrupt climate change</keyword><keyword>buoyant flow</keyword><keyword>freshwater</keyword><keyword>meltwater</keyword><keyword>paleoclimate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010GL046011</electronic-resource-num><notes>Condron, A., and P.

Using a high-resolution (1/6°) global, ocean-ice circulation model we present an alternative view that freshwater discharged from glacial Lake Agassiz would have remained on the continental shelf as a narrow, buoyant, coastal current, and would have been transported south into the subtropical North Atlantic. The pathway we describe is in contrast to the conceptual idea that freshwater from this lake outburst spread over most of the sub-polar North Atlantic, and covered the deep, open-ocean, convection regions. This coastally confined freshwater pathway is consistent with the present-day routing of freshwater from Hudson Bay, as well as paleoceanographic evidence of this event. Using a coarse-resolution (2.6°) version of the same model, we demonstrate that the previously reported spreading of freshwater across the sub-polar North Atlantic results from the inability of numerical models of this resolution to accurately resolve narrow coastal flows, producing instead a diffuse circulation that advects freshwater away from the boundaries. To understand the climatic impact of freshwater released in the past or future (e.g. Greenland and Antarctica), the ocean needs to be modeled at a resolution sufficient to resolve the dynamics of narrow, coastal buoyant flows.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, Xujing Jia</author><author>Rothstein, Lewis M</author><author>Dewar, William K</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Numerical Investigations of Seasonal and Interannual Variability of North Pacific Subtropical Mode Water and Its Implications for Pacific Climate Variability</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>2648-2665</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Seasonal variability,Interannual variability,North</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2010JCLI3435.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Davis, X.

This study examines the seasonal-to-interannual variability of NPSTMW, the physical processes responsible for this variability, and the connections between NPSTMW and basin-scale climate signals using an eddy-permitting 1979–2006 ocean simulation made available by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2). The monthly mean seasonal cycle of NPSTMW in the simulation exhibits three distinct phases: (i) formation during November–March, (ii) isolation during March–June, and (iii) dissipation during June–November—each corresponding to significant changes in upper-ocean structure. An interannual signal is also evident in NPSTMW volume and other characteristic properties with volume minima occurring in 1979, 1988, and 1999. This volume variability is correlated with the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) with zero time lag. Further analyses demonstrate the connection of NPSTMW to the basin-scale ocean circulation. With this, modulations of upper-ocean structure driven by the varying strength and position of the westerlies as well as the regional air–sea heat flux pattern are seen to contribute to the variability of NPSTMW volume on interannual time scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Downes, S M</author><author>Gnanadesikan, A</author><author>Griffies, S M</author><author>Sarmiento, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water Mass Exchange in the Southern Ocean in Coupled Climate Models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1756-1771</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>air-sea fluxes</keyword><keyword>deacon cell</keyword><keyword>flow patterns</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>ice</keyword><keyword>overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>simulation</keyword><keyword>total geostrophic circulation</keyword><keyword>transformation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2011jpo4586.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Downes, S.

The meridional transport of deep and intermediate waters across 30 degrees S agrees well between models and observationally based estimates in the Atlantic Ocean but not in the Indian and Pacific, where the model-based estimates are much smaller. Associated with this, in the models about half the southward-flowing deep water is converted into lighter waters and half is converted to denser bottom waters, whereas the observationally based estimates convert most of the inflowing deep water to bottom waters. In the models, both Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) are formed primarily via an interior diapycnal transformation rather than being transformed at the surface via heat or freshwater fluxes. Given the small vertical diffusivity specified in the models in this region, the authors conclude that other processes such as cabbeling and thermobaricity must be playing an important role in water mass transformation. Finally, in the models, the largest contribution of the surface buoyancy fluxes in the Southern Ocean is to convert Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) and AAIW into lighter Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW).</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Driving ecosystem and biogeochemical models with optimal state estimates of the ocean circulation</title><secondary-title>CLIVAR Exchanges 9 (1)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CLIVAR Exchanges 9 (1)</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><notes>Dutkiewicz, S., 2011: Driving ecosystem and biogeochemical models with optimal state estimates of the ocean circulation.

Over the past decade, marine ecosystem and biogeochemistry models have begun to address some of this diversity by resolving several groups of (mostly autotrophic) plankton, differentiated by biogeochemical function. Here, we review recent model approaches that are rooted in the notion that an even richer diversity is fundamental to the organization of marine microbial communities. These models begin to resolve, and address the significance of, diversity within functional groups. Seeded with diverse populations spanning prescribed regions of trait space, these simulations self-select community structure according to relative fitness in the virtual environment. Such models are suited to considering ecological questions, such as the regulation of patterns of biodiversity, and to simulating the response to changing environments. A key issue for all such models is the constraint of viable trait space and trade-offs. Size-structuring and mechanistic descriptions of energy and resource allocation at the individual level can rationalize these constraints.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Maze, Guillaume</author><author>Buckley, Martha</author><author>Marshall, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated Seasonal Cycle of North Atlantic Eighteen Degree Water Volume</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>269-286</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Seasonal cycle,North Atlantic,Water masses,Airndas</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2010JPO4257.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Forget, G., G.

The EDW layer is defined as all waters that have a temperature between 17° and 19°C. The study is facilitated by a synthesis of various observations—principally Argo profiles of temperature and salinity, sea surface temperature, and altimetry—using a general circulation model as an interpolation tool. The winter increase in EDW volume is most pronounced in February, peaking at about 8.6 Svy, where 1 Svy ≈ 3.15 × 1013 m3 corresponding to a 1 Sv (Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1) flow sustained for one year. This largely reflects winter EDW formation due to air–sea heat fluxes. Over the remainder of the year, newly created EDW is consumed by air–sea heat fluxes and ocean mixing, which roughly contribute ⅔ and ⅓, respectively. The authors estimate a net annual volume increase of 1.4 Svy, averaged over the 3-yr period. It is small compared to the amplitude of the seasonal cycle (8.6 Svy) and annual formation due to air–sea fluxes (4.6 Svy). The overall EDW layer volume thus appears to fluctuate around a stable point during the study period. An estimate of the full EDW volume budget is provided along with an uncertainty estimate of 1.8 Svy, and largely resolves apparent conflicts between previous estimates.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, S</author><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of mixing on the subduction of South Pacific waters identified by a simulated passive tracer and its adjoint</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>45-54</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>gcm</keyword><keyword>mixed-layer</keyword><keyword>mixing</keyword><keyword>mode waters</keyword><keyword>north-pacific</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>origin</keyword><keyword>pathway</keyword><keyword>south pacific</keyword><keyword>subduction</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>tracer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/J.Dynatmoce.2010.10.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gao, S., T.

Model simulations using a passive tracer and its adjoint are employed in conjunction with a particle tracking method to distinguish effects of mixing from those of advection. The results show that mixing processes can contribute to as much as 20% of the overall subduction rate in the South Pacific. Of this mixing contribution, about 30% can be attributed to meso-scale eddies, including their associated bolus transport, while the major part (70%) is due to other diabatic processes. The impact of mixing reaches its maximum near the Sub-Antarctic Front, accounting for nearly 30% of the total subduction rate. Consequently, estimates based on tracing particles or on advection alone may significantly underestimate the subduction rate in the South Pacific Ocean. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The data were collected with two ocean bottom pressure meters (OBPs), constructed at the University of Bremen, that are capable of recording signals with frequencies up to 0.25 Hz. Over the long-term, a nearly 2.5 kPa (25 cm water column equivalent) pressure variation over 3.7 years is observed, which is consistent with uplift followed by subsidence, but cannot unequivocally be discerned from instrumental drift. Medium-term pressure variations are compared with satellite surface topography, satellite gravity, ocean modeling, and in situ data from an OBP 700 km away. It is shown that fluctuations in the oceanic mass distribution dominate the variations in this frequency range and that oceanic modeling and data from a 700 km distant OBP are positively correlated with the LHF bottom pressure time series. The short-term variations are dominated by microseisms originating from sea surface waves and pressure waves from earthquakes as can be shown by comparison with weather buoy and teleseismic data.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halkides, D</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Kida, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms controlling the seasonal mixed-layer temperature and salinity of the Indonesian seas</title><secondary-title>Ocean Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>481-495</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>Indonesian seas</keyword><keyword>Mixed layer</keyword><keyword>Ocean-state estimation</keyword><keyword>Seasonal heat budget</keyword><keyword>Seasonal salinity</keyword><keyword>budget</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>gcm</keyword><keyword>maritime continent</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>parameterization</keyword><keyword>region</keyword><keyword>sensitivity</keyword><keyword>throughflow</keyword><keyword>upper ocean</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10236-010-0374-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Halkides, D., T.

MLT in these seas is relatively high during November-May (austral spring through fall) and relatively low during June-September (austral winter and the period associated with the Asian summer monsoon). Surface heat flux makes the largest contribution to the seasonal MLT tendency, with significant reinforcement by subsurface processes, especially turbulent vertical mixing. Temperature declines (the MLT tendency is negative) in May-August when seasonal insolation is smallest and local winds are strong due to the southeast monsoon, which causes surface heat loss and cooling by vertical processes. In particular, Ekman suction induced by local wind stress curl raises the thermocline in the Arafura Sea, bringing cooler subsurface water closer to the base of the mixed layer where it is subsequently incorporated into the mixed layer through turbulent vertical mixing; this has a cooling effect. The MLT budget also has a small, but non-negligible, semi-annual component since insolation increases and winds weaken during the spring and fall monsoon transitions near the equator. This causes warming via solar heating, reduced surface heat loss, and weakened turbulent mixing compared to austral winter and, to a lesser extent, compared to austral summer. Seasonal MLS is dominated by ocean processes rather than by local freshwater flux. The contributions by horizontal advection and subsurface processes have comparable magnitudes. The results suggest that ocean dynamics play a significant part in determining both seasonal MLT and MLS in the region, such that coupled model studies of the region should use a full ocean model rather than a slab ocean mixed-layer model.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Utke, Jean</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Timescales and regions of the sensitivity of Atlantic meridional volume and heat transport: Toward observing system design</title><secondary-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1858-1879</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>17-18</issue><keywords><keyword>Adjoint sensitivities</keyword><keyword>Decadal variability</keyword><keyword>Dual state space</keyword><keyword>Meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>Observing system design</keyword><keyword>Oceanic teleconnections</keyword><keyword>Poleward heat transport</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dsr2.2010.10.065</electronic-resource-num><notes>Heimbach, P., C.

Focus is on the effect of temperature (and salinity) perturbations. On short timescales (months), as expected, the greatest sensitivities are to local disturbances, but as the timescales extend back to a decade and longer, the region of influence expands to occupy much of the Atlantic basin and significant areas of the global ocean, although the influence of any specific point or small area tends to be quite weak. The propagation of information in the dual solution is a clear manifestation of oceanic teleconnections. It takes place through identifiable “dual” Kelvin, Rossby, and continental shelf-waves with an interpretable physics, in particular in terms of dual expressions of barotropic and baroclinic adjustment processes. Among the notable features are the relatively fast timescales of influence (albeit weak in amplitude) between 26°N and the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean, the absence of dominance of the sub-polar North Atlantic, significant connections to the Agulhas leakage region in the southeast Atlantic on timescales of 5–10 years, and the marked sensitivity propagation of Doppler-shifted Rossby waves in the Southern Ocean on timescales of a decade and beyond. Regional, as well as time-dependent, differences between MVT and MHT sensitivities highlight the lack of a simple correspondence between their variability. Some implications for observing systems for the purpose of climate science are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holloway, Greg</author><author>Nguyen, An</author><author>Wang, Zeliang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceans and ocean models as seen by current meters</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C8</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>observing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC007044</electronic-resource-num><notes>Holloway, G., A.

We affirm previous indications of strongly positive topostrophy toward higher latitudes, and we consider variation with depth. We explore use of the current meter data set for evaluating models skills. This is illustrated from two models applied to Arctic Ocean circulation: (1) examining the influence of successive grid refinement in a high-resolution eddy-active model and (2) assessing skill in a coarse-resolution noneddying model for which effects of unresolved eddies are parameterized. We see that finer-grid eddy-active models achieve higher topostrophy and improved skill. We find that a coarse-grid noneddying model can be improved by parameterization.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ito, T</author><author>Hamme, R C</author><author>Emerson, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal and spatial variability of noble gas tracers in the North Pacific</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><keywords><keyword>argon</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>helium</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>neon</keyword><keyword>nitrogen</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>solubility</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010jc006828</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ito, T., R.

The distribution of argon and neon is simulated using the time-varying, three-dimensional circulation fields determined by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Oceans (ECCO) project from 1992 to 2008. The model is in overall agreement with limited observational data from the subpolar and subtropical North Pacific using a relatively low vertical diffusivity. Temporal variability in argon saturation is enhanced in the surface ocean, dominated by diffusive gas exchange coupled to air-sea heat fluxes. This variability in surface argon saturation is significantly correlated to the Southern Oscillation Index (El Nino) in the tropics and to the North Pacific Index in midlatitudes. Using sensitivity experiments, we find that the mean state of argon saturation in the ventilated thermocline is characterized by a mutual compensation between mixing-induced supersaturation and sea level pressure and heat-flux-induced undersaturation. Neon distributions exhibit a stronger influence from bubble-mediated gas fluxes that is partially compensated by the effect of sea level pressure variation. Our result demonstrates the important role of air-sea interaction and ocean mixing in controlling the mean state of the dissolved noble gases and highlights the importance of diffusive gas exchange coupled to air-sea heat fluxes in controlling temporal variability, with implications for using noble gas measurements to derive estimates of diapycnal diffusivity in the subtropical thermocline.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, S G</author><author>Zhang, L J</author><author>Tapley, B D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The understanding of length-of-day variations from satellite gravity and laser ranging measurements</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><pages>651-660</pages><volume>184</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Earth</keyword><keyword>Satellite geodesy</keyword><keyword>Time series analysis</keyword><keyword>Time variable gravity</keyword><keyword>atmospheric angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>earths</keyword><keyword>field</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>lageos</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean tides</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>rotation</keyword><keyword>rotation variations</keyword><keyword>seasonal-variations</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04869.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Jin, S.

Numerous studies on the LOD excitations have been made from climatological/hydrological assimilation systems and models of the general circulation of the ocean. However, quantitative assessment and understanding of the contributions to the LOD remain unclear due mainly to the lack of direct global observations. In this paper, the total Earth's surface fluids mass excitations to the LOD at seasonal and intraseasonal timescales are investigated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Estimating Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-analysis (ERA)-Interim, GRACE-derived surface fluids mass and the spherical harmonics coefficient C-20 from the satellite laser ranging (SLR) as well as combined GRACE+SLR solutions, respectively. Results show that the GRACE and the combined GRACE and SLR solutions better explain the geodetic residual LOD excitations at annual and semi-annual timescales. For less than 1 yr timescales, GRACE-derived mass is worse to explain the geodetic residuals, whereas SLR agrees better with the geodetic residuals. However, the combined GRACE and SLR results are much improved in explaining the geodetic residual excitations at intraseasonal scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manizza, M</author><author>Follows, M J</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>McClelland, J W</author><author>Hill, C N</author><author>Peterson, B J</author><author>Key, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A model of the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>0428 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>0793 Biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modelin</keyword><keyword>4820 Gases</keyword><keyword>air-sea gas exchange</keyword><keyword>biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>land-ocean coupling</keyword><keyword>numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>ocean carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>polar oceans</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC006998</electronic-resource-num><notes>Manizza, M., M.

The model qualitatively captures the observed regional and seasonal trends in surface ocean PO4, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and pCO2. Integrated annually, over the basin, the model suggests a net annual uptake of 59 Tg C a−1, within the range of published estimates based on the extrapolation of local observations (20–199 Tg C a−1). This flux is attributable to the cooling (increasing solubility) of waters moving into the basin, mainly from the subpolar North Atlantic. The air-sea flux is regulated seasonally and regionally by sea-ice cover, which modulates both air-sea gas transfer and the photosynthetic production of organic matter, and by the delivery of riverine dissolved organic carbon (RDOC), which drive the regional contrasts in pCO2 between Eurasian and North American coastal waters. Integrated over the basin, the delivery and remineralization of RDOC reduces the net oceanic CO2 uptake by ∼10%.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Monteiro, F M</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Follows, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biogeographical controls on the marine nitrogen fixers</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>25</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>0469 Nitrogen cycling</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modelin</keyword><keyword>4815 Ecosystems, structure, dynamics, and modeling</keyword><keyword>4855 Phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>biogeography</keyword><keyword>iron cycle</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>nitrogen fixers</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>resource competition theory</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010GB003902</electronic-resource-num><notes>Monteiro, F.

As is observed, the model's total diazotroph population is distributed over most of the oligotrophic warm subtropical and tropical waters, with the exception of the southeastern Pacific Ocean. This biogeography broadly follows temperature and light constraints which are often used in both field-based and model studies to explain the distribution of diazotrophs. However, the model suggests that diazotroph habitat is not directly controlled by temperature and light, but is restricted to the ocean regions with low fixed nitrogen and sufficient dissolved iron and phosphate concentrations. We interpret this regulation by iron and phosphate using resource competition theory which provides an excellent qualitative and quantitative framework.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, An T</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Kwok, Ronald</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Arctic ice-ocean simulation with optimized model parameters: Approach and assessment</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C4</issue><keywords><keyword>1910 Data assimilation, integration and fusion</keyword><keyword>1952 Modeling</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4283 Water masses</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>data</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>optimization</keyword><keyword>sea ice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010JC006573</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nguyen, A.

A Green's function approach adjusts a set of parameters for best model-data agreement. Overall, model-data differences are reduced by 45%. The optimized simulation reproduces the negative trends in ice extent in the satellite records. Volume and thickness distributions are comparable to those from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (2003–2008). The upper cold halocline is consistent with observations in the western Arctic. The freshwater budget of the Arctic Ocean and volume/heat transports of Pacific and Atlantic waters across major passages are comparable with observation-based estimates. We note that the optimized parameters depend on the selected atmospheric forcing. The use of the 25 year Japanese reanalysis results in sea ice albedos that are consistent with field observations. Simulated Pacific Water enters the Bering Strait and flows off the Chukchi Shelf along four distinct channels. This water takes ∼5–10 years to exit the Arctic Ocean at the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Nares, or Fram straits. Atlantic Water entering the Fram Strait flows eastward, merges with the St Ana Trough inflow, and splits into two branches at the southwest corner of the Makarov Basin. One branch flows along Lomonosov Ridge back to Fram Strait. The other enters the western Arctic, circulates cyclonically below the halocline, and exits mainly through the Nares and Fram straits. This work utilizes the record of available observations to obtain an Arctic Ocean simulation that is in agreement with observations both within and beyond the optimization period and that can be used for tracer and process studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, C G</author><author>Ponte, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of interannual steric sea level variability</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>4568 Turbulence</keyword><keyword>and mixing processes</keyword><keyword>closed property budgets</keyword><keyword>diffusion</keyword><keyword>ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>sea level variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GL048440</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

The estimate's dynamical consistency allows for the comprehensive attribution of steric changes in terms of advection, diffusion, and surface buoyancy exchange processes. Steric variations are found to be owing more to oceanic transports than to local surface buoyancy fluxes. Advection is responsible for steric variability in the tropical Indian and Pacific oceans. At extratropical latitudes, advection and diffusion appear to be equally important. Local surface buoyancy fluxes can contribute in some regions (e.g., the tropical Atlantic). Analysis of the anomalous wind stress curl shows that extra-equatorial vertical advection is driven primarily by Ekman pumping. The complexity of the interannual steric budget suggests that anomalous sea level is probably not predictable on the basis of ocean memory alone. Furthermore, proper parameterizations of mixing processes and good estimates of wind-driven transports both appear to be very important to reliable projections of interannual sea level.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Gao, S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What governs the North Atlantic salinity maximum in a global GCM?</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><keywords><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>mixed-layer</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>sea-surface salinity</keyword><keyword>trends</keyword><keyword>tropical atlantic</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011gl046757</electronic-resource-num><notes>Qu, T.

Salinity budget terms were computed at the model's integration time step and archived as monthly averages. The simulated mixed layer salinity budget provides the first quantitative evidence for the ocean's role in governing the sea surface salinity maximum in the North Atlantic. Our analysis reveals that ocean dynamics explains about half of the sea surface salinity variance, being of equal importance as surface forcing. The sea surface salinity maximum varies both seasonally and interannually, as a consequence of interplay among surface flux, advection, and vertical entrainment. Contribution from eddies and small-scale processes is relatively weak but not negligible. These results may provide useful hints for the design and interpretation of future observations in the region. Citation: Qu, T., S. Gao, and I.

We assess how well we know such rapid, non-tidal p(b) signals by analyzing in-situ bottom pressure recorder (BPR) data and available global estimates from two very different modeling approaches. Estimated p(b) variance is generally lower than that measured by the BPRs, implying the presence of correlated model errors. Deriving uncertainties from differencing the model estimates can thus severely underestimate the aliasing errors. Removing estimated series from BPR data tends to reduce the variance by up to similar to 5 cm(2) but residual variance is still similar to 5-20 cm(2) and not negligible relative to expected variance in climate p(b) signals. The residual p(b) variability can be correlated over hundreds of kilometers. Results indicate the need to improve estimates of rapid p(b) variability in order to minimize aliasing noise in current and future satellite-based p(b) observations. Citation: Quinn, K. J., and R. M.

Direct rates of wind work can be calculated through the wind stress acting on the surface geostrophic flow. However, because that energy is transported laterally in the Ekman layer, the injection into the geostrophic interior is actually controlled by Ekman pumping, with a pattern determined by the wind curl rather than the wind itself. Regions of power injection into the geostrophic interior are thus generally shifted poleward compared to regions of direct wind-power input, most notably in the Southern Ocean, where on average energy enters the interior 10° south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current core. An interpretation of the wind-power input to the interior is proposed, expressed as a downward flux of pressure work. This energy flux is a measure of the work done by the Ekman pumping against the surface elevation pressure, helping to maintain the observed anomaly of sea surface height relative to the global-mean sea level.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rampal, P</author><author>Weiss, J</author><author>Dubois, C</author><author>Campin, J M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>IPCC climate models do not capture Arctic sea ice drift acceleration: Consequences in terms of projected sea ice thinning and decline</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C8</issue><keywords><keyword>0750 Sea ice</keyword><keyword>0762 Mass balance</keyword><keyword>0798 Modeling</keyword><keyword>1626 Global climate models</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>IPCC climate models</keyword><keyword>decline</keyword><keyword>kinematics</keyword><keyword>sea-ice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC007110</electronic-resource-num><notes>Rampal, P., J.

The recent Arctic sea ice decline is also characterized by a rapid thinning and by an increase of sea ice kinematics (velocities and deformation rates), with both processes being coupled through positive feedbacks. In this study we show that IPCC climate models underestimate the observed thinning trend by a factor of almost 4 on average and fail to capture the associated accelerated motion. The coupling between the ice state (thickness and concentration) and ice velocity is unexpectedly weak in most models. In particular, sea ice drifts faster during the months when it is thick and packed than when it is thin, contrary to what is observed; also models with larger long-term thinning trends do not show higher drift acceleration. This weak coupling behavior (1) suggests that the positive feedbacks mentioned above are underestimated and (2) can partly explain the models' underestimation of the recent sea ice area, thickness, and velocity trends. Due partly to this weak coupling, ice export does not play an important role in the simulated negative balance of Arctic sea ice mass between 1950 and 2050. If we assume a positive trend on ice speeds at straits equivalent to the one observed since 1979 within the Arctic basin, first-order estimations give shrinking and thinning trends that become significantly closer to the observations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saito, Mak A</author><author>Bertrand, Erin M</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Bulygin, Vladimir V</author><author>Moran, Dawn M</author><author>Monteiro, Fanny M</author><author>Follows, Michael J</author><author>Valois, Frederica W</author><author>Waterbury, John B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Iron conservation by reduction of metalloenzyme inventories in the marine diazotroph Crocosphaera watsonii</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2184-2189</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1006943108</electronic-resource-num><notes>Saito, M.

Here we use global and targeted proteomic analyses on a key unicellular marine diazotroph Crocosphaera watsonii to reveal large scale diel changes in its proteome, including substantial variations in concentrations of iron metalloproteins involved in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, as well as nocturnal flavodoxin production. The daily synthesis and degradation of enzymes in coordination with their utilization results in a lowered cellular metalloenzyme inventory that requires ∼40% less iron than if these enzymes were maintained throughout the diel cycle. This strategy is energetically expensive, but appears to serve as an important adaptation for confronting the iron scarcity of the open oceans. A global numerical model of ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and ecosystems suggests that Crocosphaera’s ability to reduce its iron-metalloenzyme inventory provides two advantages: It allows Crocosphaera to inhabit regions lower in iron and allows the same iron supply to support higher Crocosphaera biomass and nitrogen fixation than if they did not have this reduced iron requirement.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spreen, Gunnar</author><author>Kwok, Ron</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trends in Arctic sea ice drift and role of wind forcing: 1992–2009</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>0750 Sea ice</keyword><keyword>0758 Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>1621 Cryospheric change</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>drift</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword><keyword>sea ice</keyword><keyword>trends</keyword><keyword>wind</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GL048970</electronic-resource-num><notes>Spreen, G., R.

Between 1992 and 2009, the spatially averaged trend in drift speed within the Arctic Basin is 10.6% ± 0.9%/decade, and ranges between −4% and 16%/decade depending on the location. The mean trend is dominated by the second half of the period. In fact, for the five years after a clear break point in March 2004, the average trend increased to 46% ± 5%/decade. Over the 1992–2009 period, averaged trends of wind speed from four atmospheric reanalyses are only 1% to 2%/decade. Regionally, positive trends in wind speed (of up to 9%/decade) are seen over a large fraction of the Central Arctic, where the trends in drift speeds are highest. Spatial correlations between the basin-wide trends in wind and drift speeds are moderate (between 0.40 and 0.52). Our results suggest that changes in wind speed explain a fraction of the observed increase in drift speeds in the Central Arctic but not over the entire basin. In other regions thinning of the ice cover is a more likely cause of the increase in ice drift speed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tulloch, Ross</author><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Smith, K Shafer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scales, Growth Rates, and Spectral Fluxes of Baroclinic Instability in the Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1057-1076</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Baroclinic flows,Eddies,Mesoscale processes,Instab</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2011JPO4404.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tulloch, R., J.

The geography of the large-scale, meridional quasigeostrophic potential vorticity (QGPV) gradient is mapped out using a climatological atlas, and attention is drawn to asymmetries between midlatitude eastward currents and subtropical return flows, the latter of which has westward and eastward zonal velocity shears. A linear stability analysis of the climatology, under the “local approximation,” yields the growth rates and scales of the fastest-growing modes. Fastest-growing modes on eastward-flowing currents, such as the Kuroshio and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, have a scale somewhat larger (by a factor of about 2) than Rdef. They are rapidly growing (e folding in 1–3 weeks) and deep reaching, and they can be characterized by an interaction between interior QGPV gradients, with a zero crossing in the QGPV gradient at depth. In contrast, fastest-growing modes in the subtropical return flows (as well as much of the gyre interiors) have a scale smaller than Rdef (by a factor of between 0.5 and 1), grow more slowly (e-folding scale of several weeks), and owe their existence to the interaction of a positive surface QGPV gradient and a negative gradient beneath.These predictions of linear theory under the local approximation are then compared to observed eddy length scales and spectral fluxes using altimetric data. It is found that the scale of observed eddies is some 2–3 times larger than the instability scale, indicative of a modest growth in horizontal scale. No evidence of an inverse cascade over decades in scale is found. Outside of a tropical band, the eddy scale varies with latitude along with but somewhat less strongly than Rdef.Finally, exactly the same series of calculations is carried out on fields from an idealized global eddying model, enabling study in a more controlled setting. Broadly similar conclusions are reached, thus reinforcing inferences made from the data.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ubelmann, Clement</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vorticity Structures in the Tropical Pacific from a Numerical Simulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1455-1464</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Vorticity,Tropics,Pacific Ocean,Ocean modeling,Num</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2011JPO4507.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ubelmann, C., and L.-L.

A Lagrangian method based on the Okubo–Weiss parameter is used to identify the structures and track their main characteristics. Between 8°S and 8°N, the structure characteristics are spatially inhomogeneous compared to higher latitudes. They can be grouped into three categories: anticyclonic and cyclonic structures off the equator and the equatorial structures between 2°S and 2°N. They all have a strong annual cycle with maximum presence from September to March, except during strong El Niño years, when the number of structures becomes very low. Off the equator from 2° to 8°, the anticyclonic structures dominate, but with drastically different characteristics north and south of the equator. In the north, large nonlinear vortices develop (known as the tropical instability vortices) in phase with the 30–35-day oscillation related to an unstable first-meridional-mode Rossby waves. In the south, mostly fragmentary linear structures are present, with lower propagation speeds. The equatorial structures are mostly counterclockwise. The larger ones tend to be linear and are clearly associated with Yanai waves. The large majority of the cyclonic structures off the equator are also quite linear and smaller and less numerous than the anticyclonic structures. However, some of them are nonlinear with vorticity values higher than 2 times the Coriolis parameter.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ubelmann, Clement</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cyclonic eddies formed at the Pacific tropical instability wave fronts</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>4283 Water masses</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4528 Fronts and jets</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>TIW</keyword><keyword>eddy</keyword><keyword>front</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC007204</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ubelmann, C., and L.-L.

The objective of this paper is to establish the relationship between these variations and atmospheric forcing over the subtropical North Atlantic. Based on satellite altimetry, hydrography, and atmospheric reanalysis products, it is demonstrated that the interannual variability of the Azores Current eastward velocity and eddy energy may be driven by the adjustment of the ocean to the strength of westerly and trade winds, modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation. Surface intensification (frontogenesis), which is mainly due to the wind-driven meridional Ekman current convergence, is found significant, but not sufficient to explain the observed interannual variability of the Azores Current strength.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Zeliang</author><author>Holloway, Greg</author><author>Hannah, Charles</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of parameterized eddy stress on volume, heat, and freshwater transports through Fram Strait</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C8</issue><keywords><keyword>4299 General or miscellaneous</keyword><keyword>Fram Strait</keyword><keyword>eddy stress</keyword><keyword>transports</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010JC006871</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wang, Z., G.

Here we investigate NTOL effects on 3-4 year GPS height time series from 17 sites around the southern North Sea, and compute the NTOL displacement according to two ocean models; the global ECCO model and a high resolution regional model, POLSSM, which covers the northwest European continental shelf. To assess the susceptibility of GPS height estimates to NTOL, reprocessed GIPSY PPP daily solutions are corrected for the resulting displacement, together with atmospheric pressure loading (ATML). We find that the displacements due to NTOL are comparable in size to ATML and the combined correction reduces the variance by 12-22 mm2 (20-30% reduction in RMS). We find that POLSSM outperforms ECCO, with around an 11% greater variance reduction, and hence high resolution models are recommended to correct GPS heights for NTOL. Citation: Williams, S. D.

Accurately realizing and maintaining ITRF origin at the mean Earth system center of mass (CM) is critical to surface and spacecraft based geodetic measurements including those of sea level rise and its sources. Although ITRF combines data from satellite laser ranging (SLR), Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS), its origin is currently realized by the single technique of SLR. Consequently, it is difficult to independently evaluate the origin accuracy. Also, whether the solid Earth is expanding or shrinking has attracted persistent attention. The expansion rate, if any, has not been accurately determined before, due to insufficient data coverage on the Earth's surface and the presence of other geophysical processes. Here, we use multiple precise geodetic data sets and a simultaneous global estimation platform to determine that the ITRF2008 origin is consistent with the mean CM at the level of 0.5 mm yr(-1), and the mean radius of the Earth is not changing to within 1 sigma measurement uncertainty of 0.2 mm yr(-1).

Near the edge of the core regions of high eddy energy, agreement is observed with the prediction of the surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) turbulence theory, which has fundamental differences from that of the traditional quasigeostrophic (QG) turbulence theory. In the core regions of high eddy energy, the spectra are consistent with frontogenesis that is not fully accounted for by the SQG theory. However, the observations in the vast ocean interior of low eddy energy exhibit substantial differences from the predictions of existing theories of oceanic mesoscale turbulence. The spectra in these regions may reflect the ocean’s response to short-scale atmospheric forcing and air–sea interaction. The observations presented in this paper serve as a test bed for new theories and ocean general circulation models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Yongsheng</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author><author>Tulloch, Ross</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Global Characteristics of the Wavenumber Spectrum of Ocean Surface Wind</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1576-1582</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-11-059.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Xu, Y., L.-L.

The optimal three-dimensional spatial structure of temperature and salinity perturbations, defined as the leading singular vector and generating the maximum amplification of MOC anomalies, is evaluated by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem using tangent linear and adjoint models. Despite the stable linearized dynamics, a large amplification of MOC anomalies, mostly due to the interference of nonnormal modes, is initiated by the optimal perturbations. The largest amplification of MOC anomalies, found to be excited by high-latitude deep density perturbations in the northern part of the basin, is achieved after about 7.5 years. The anomalies grow as a result of a conversion of mean available potential energy into potential and kinetic energy of the perturbations, reminiscent of baroclinic instability. The time scale of growth of MOC anomalies can be understood by examining the time evolution of deep zonal density gradients, which are related to the MOC via the thermal wind relation. The velocity of propagation of the density anomalies, found to depend on the horizontal component of the mean flow velocity and the mean density gradient, determines the growth time scale of the MOC anomalies and therefore provides an upper bound on the MOC predictability time. The results suggest that the nonnormal linearized ocean dynamics can give rise to enhanced MOC variability if, for instance, overflows, eddies, and/or deep convection can excite high-latitude density anomalies in the ocean interior with a structure resembling that of the optimal perturbations found in this study. The findings also indicate that errors in ocean initial conditions or in model parameterizations or processes, particularly at depth, may significantly reduce the Atlantic MOC predictability time to less than a decade.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abernathey, Ryan</author><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Mazloff, Matt</author><author>Shuckburgh, Emily</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancement of Mesoscale Eddy Stirring at Steering Levels in the Southern Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>170-184</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Eddies,Mesoscale processes,Southern Ocean,Diffusio</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2009JPO4201.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Abernathey, R., J.

The effective diffusivity, Keff, characterizes the rate at which mesoscale eddies stir properties on interior isopycnal surfaces and laterally at the sea surface. The distributions are obtained by monitoring the rate at which eddies stir an idealized tracer whose initial distribution varies monotonically across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). In the absence of observed maps of eddying currents in the interior ocean, the advecting velocity field is taken from an eddy-permitting state estimate of the Southern Ocean (SOSE). A three-dimensional advection–diffusion equation is solved and the diffusivity diagnosed by applying the Nakamura technique on both horizontal and isopycnal surfaces. The resulting meridional sections of Keff reveal intensified isopycnal eddy stirring (reaching values of ∼2000 m2 s−1) in a layer deep beneath the ACC but rising toward the surface on the equatorward flank. Lower effective diffusivity values (∼500 m2 s−1) are found near the surface where the mean flow of the ACC is strongest. It is argued that Keff is enhanced in the vicinity of the steering level of baroclinic waves, which is deep along the axis of the ACC but shallows on the equatorial flank. Values of Keff are also found to be spatially correlated with gradients of potential vorticity on isopycnal surfaces and are large where those gradients are weak and vice versa, as expected from simple dynamical arguments. Finally, implications of the spatial distributions of Keff for the dynamics of the ACC and its overturning circulation are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baehr, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of the 26 degrees N RAPID-MOCHA Array and Florida Current Cable Observations on the ECCO-GODAE State Estimate</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>865-879</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>26.5-degrees-n</keyword><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>combining argo profiles</keyword><keyword>construction</keyword><keyword>heat-transport</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2009jpo4118.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Baehr, J., 2010: Influence of the 26 degrees N RAPID-MOCHA Array and Florida Current Cable Observations on the ECCO-GODAE State Estimate.

Incorporating both monthly means of the FC data and monthly means of the RAPID-MOCHA temperature and salinity measurements at the eastern and western boundaries of the basin as an observational constraint in a 1-yr experiment results in an adjustment to the reference estimate, which does not include these datasets, of approximately 1 Sv (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) in the MOC at 26 degrees N and the adjacent latitudes (approximately +/- 15 degrees), with a larger northward branch of the MOC above 1000 m, compensated by a larger flow in the southward branch of the MOC between approximately 2000 and 3000 m.

We examined a global ocean circulation, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem model that indicated a decrease in phytoplankton diversity with increasing latitude, consistent with observations of many marine and terrestrial taxa. In the modeled subpolar oceans, seasonal variability of the environment led to competitive exclusion of phytoplankton with slower growth rates and lower diversity. The relatively weak seasonality of the stable subtropical and tropical oceans in the global model enabled long exclusion time scales and prolonged coexistence of multiple phytoplankton with comparable fitness. Superimposed on the decline in diversity seen from equator to pole were “hot spots” of enhanced diversity in some regions of energetic ocean circulation, which reflected lateral dispersal.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borreguero, Laura Herraiz</author><author>Mottram, Ruth</author><author>Cvijanovic, Ivana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Discussing Progress in Understanding Ice Sheet—Ocean Interactions: Advanced Climate Dynamics Course 2010: Ice Sheet—Ocean Interactions; Lyngen, Norway, 8–19 June 2010</title><secondary-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</full-title></periodical><pages>419</pages><volume>91</volume><issue>45</issue><keywords><keyword>0726 Ice sheets</keyword><keyword>0728 Ice shelves</keyword><keyword>1223 Ocean/Earth/atmosphere/hydrosphere/cryosphere</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>climate dynamics</keyword><keyword>ocean–ice sheet interactions</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword><keyword>summer course</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010EO450006</electronic-resource-num><notes>Borreguero, L.

Major uncertainties in sea level rise projections relate to the response of ice sheets to sea level rise and the key role that interactions with the ocean may play. Recognizing that probably no comprehensive curriculum currently exists at any single university that covers this novel and interdisciplinary subject, the Advanced Climate Dynamics Courses (ACDC) team brought together a group of 40 international students, postdocs, and lecturers from diverse backgrounds to provide an overview and discussion of state-of-the-art research into ocean—ice sheet interactions and to propose research priorities for the next decade. Among the key issues addressed were small-scale processes near the Antarctic ice shelves and Greenland outlet glaciers. These are fast changing components in the climate system, often related to large-scale forcings (atmospheric teleconnections and oceanic circulation). Progress in understanding and modeling is hampered by the range of scales involved, the lack of observations, and the difficulties in constraining, initializing, and providing adequate boundary conditions for ice sheet and ocean models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bragg, J G</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Jahn, O</author><author>Follows, M J</author><author>Chisholm, S W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling Selective Pressures on Phytoplankton in the Global Ocean</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>5</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>biogeography</keyword><keyword>cyanobacteria</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>forms</keyword><keyword>genome</keyword><keyword>lineages</keyword><keyword>marine synechococcus</keyword><keyword>nitrate assimilation</keyword><keyword>nitrogen</keyword><keyword>prochlorococcus ecotypes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0009569</electronic-resource-num><notes>Bragg, J.

It is difficult to assimilate this information into our understanding of marine microbe ecology and evolution, because their distributions, traits, and genomes are shaped by forces that are complex and dynamic. Here we incorporate diverse forces-physical, biogeochemical, ecological, and mutational-into a global ocean model to study selective pressures on a simple trait in a widely distributed lineage of picophytoplankton: the nitrogen use abilities of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria. Some Prochlorococcus ecotypes have lost the ability to use nitrate, whereas their close relatives, marine Synechococcus, typically retain it. We impose mutations for the loss of nitrogen use abilities in modeled picophytoplankton, and ask: in which parts of the ocean are mutants most disadvantaged by losing the ability to use nitrate, and in which parts are they least disadvantaged? Our model predicts that this selective disadvantage is smallest for picophytoplankton that live in tropical regions where Prochlorococcus are abundant in the real ocean. Conversely, the selective disadvantage of losing the ability to use nitrate is larger for modeled picophytoplankton that live at higher latitudes, where Synechococcus are abundant. In regions where we expect Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations to cycle seasonally in the real ocean, we find that model ecotypes with seasonal population dynamics similar to Prochlorococcus are less disadvantaged by losing the ability to use nitrate than model ecotypes with seasonal population dynamics similar to Synechococcus. The model predictions for the selective advantage associated with nitrate use are broadly consistent with the distribution of this ability among marine picocyanobacteria, and at finer scales, can provide insights into interactions between temporally varying ocean processes and selective pressures that may be difficult or impossible to study by other means. More generally, and perhaps more importantly, this study introduces an approach for testing hypotheses about the processes that underlie genetic variation among marine microbes, embedded in the dynamic physical, chemical, and biological forces that generate and shape this diversity.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dickey, J O</author><author>Marcus, S L</author><author>de Viron, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Closure in the Earth's angular momentum budget observed from subseasonal periods down to four days: No core effects needed</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>37</volume><keywords><keyword>length</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword><keyword>variable rotation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009gl041118</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dickey, J.

Previous studies have noted a lag of atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) with LOD that would imply another source. We examine AAM from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis series, along with oceanic angular momentum (OAM) from the ECCO consortium; land hydrological effects made no discernible impact. The NCEP reanalysis together with OAM produces a significant lag with LOD, while the ECMWF reanalysis AAM with OAM shows no phase lag. We find significant coherence with LOD variations down to periods of 4 days; coherence losses at shorter periods likely arise from the inverted barometer assumption and unmodeled dynamical processes.

Estimates of geostrophic transport from the data are compared with the model transport to close the volume budget north of the trans-Pacific XBT track. Advective transport from both model output and data are combined with surface fluxes to determine budgets of heat and freshwater in the closed region. The northward heat transport across the XBT track is estimated to be 0.74 ± 0.1 pW, and has variability of almost 0.5 pW on 3-4 year time scales, while freshwater transport is estimated to be - 0.1 ± 0.06 Sv. The balance between northward advective heat transport and surface heat flux gives a time-varying estimate of heat storage that compares well with observations. A similar balance is found between model estimates of advective freshwater transport and surface freshwater flux. Despite a scarcity of observations and uncertainties in all components, this analysis results in nearly closed budgets of volume, heat, and freshwater. Mean estimates of advective transport of both heat and freshwater agree with previous estimates. An analysis of each component of the heat budget with latitude indicates that a relative lack of time-variability of the surface component is consistent throughout the North Pacific. The dominant advective component is driven by changes in the wind stress curl field. For both heat and freshwater storage, strong signals occur concurrently at all latitudes. This behavior could indicate that these signals are controlled by large-scale dynamics, rather than small-scale disturbances from which signals would need to propagate to be widely felt. The analysis demonstrates the value of bringing models and data together, resulting in budgets that are consistent with observations, yet provide a comprehensive look at the variability of North Pacific heat and freshwater storage that would be unavailable from data alone. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, existing altimeter measurements are not adequate to characterize the dynamic variations of most inland water bodies, nor of ocean eddies at scales of less than about 100 km, notwithstanding that such eddies play a key role in ocean circulation and climate change. For terrestrial hydrology, in situ and spaceborne measurements of water surface elevation form the basis for estimates of water storage change in lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands, and of river discharge. However, storage in most inland water bodies, e.g., millions of Arctic lakes, is not readily measured using existing technologies. A solution to the needs of both surface water hydrology and physical oceanography communities is the measurement of water elevations along rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands and over the ocean surface using swath altimetry. The proposed surface water and ocean topography (SWOT) mission will make such measurements. The core technology for SWOT is the Ka-band radar interferometer (KaRIN), which would achieve spatial resolution on the order of tens of meters and centimetric vertical precision when averaged over targets of interest. Average revisit times will depend upon latitude, with two to four revisits at low to mid latitudes and up to ten revisits at high latitudes per ~20-day orbit repeat period.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenty, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State estimation of the Labrador Sea with a coupled sea ice-ocean adjoint model</title></titles><periodical/><pages>277</pages><volume>Ph.D.</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</publisher><notes>Fenty, I., 2010: State estimation of the Labrador Sea with a coupled sea ice-ocean adjoint model.

The nature of the dominant kinetic energy reservoir, that of the balanced variablity, is then found to be indistinguishable in the observations from a sum of barotropic and first baroclinic ordinary quasi-geostrophic modes. Little supporting evidence is available to partition the spectra among forced motions and turbulent cascades, along with significant energy more consistent with weakly non-linear wave dynamics. Linear-response wind-forced motions appear to dominate the high frequency (but subinertial) mooring frequency spectra. Turbulent cascades appear to fill the high wavenumber spectra in altimetric data and numerical simulations. Progress on these issues is hindered by the difficulty in connecting the comparatively easily available frequency spectra with the variety of theoretically predicted wavenumber spectra.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freeman, Anthony</author><author>Zlotnicki, Victor</author><author>Liu, Tim</author><author>Holt, Benjamin</author><author>Kwok, Ron</author><author>Yueh, Simon</author><author>Vazquez, Jorge</author><author>Siegel, David</author><author>Lagerloef, Gary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Measurements from Space in 2025</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>144-161</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2010.12</electronic-resource-num><notes>Freeman, A., and Coauthors, 2010: Ocean Measurements from Space in 2025.

The atlas consists of mapped observations and derived quantities. Together they form a full representation of the ocean state and its seasonal cycle. The mapped observations are primarily altimeter data, satellite SST, and Argo profiles. GCM interpolation is used to synthesize these datasets, and the resulting atlas is a fairly close fit to each one of them. For observed quantities especially, the atlas is a practical means to evaluate free-running GCM simulations and to put field experiments into a broader context. The atlas-derived quantities include the middepth dynamic topography, as well as ocean fluxes of heat and salt freshwater. The atlas is publicly available online (www.ecco-group.org). This paper provides insight into two oceanographic problems that are the subject of vigorous ongoing research. First, regarding ocean circulation estimates, it can be inferred that the RMS uncertainty in modern surface dynamic topography (SDT) estimates is only on the order of 3.5 cm at scales beyond 300 km. In that context, it is found that assumptions of &quot;reference-level&quot; dynamic topography may yield significant errors (of order 2.2 cm or more) in SDT estimates using in situ data. Second, in the perspective of mode water investigations, it is estimated that ocean fluxes (advection plus mixing) largely contribute to the seasonal fluctuation in heat content and freshwater/salt content. Hence, representing the seasonal cycle as a simple interplay of air sea flux and ocean storage would not yield a meaningful approximation. For the salt freshwater seasonal cycle especially, contributions from ocean fluxes usually exceed direct air sea flux contributions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hausman, Jessica</author><author>Zlotnicki, Victor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sea State Bias in Radar Altimetry Revisited</title><secondary-title>Marine Geodesy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine Geodesy</full-title></periodical><pages>336-347</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>sup1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01490419.2010.487804</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hausman, J., and V.

The input data are sea surface height (h) differences, separated in time by at most one repeat cycle, or the difference between measured h and a time-mean sea surface, an approach called here ?differences from the mean? (DFM). In order to release data to users soon, early estimates of SSB are computed from short time series.

As part of an ongoing effort to extend ECCO to a coupled ocean/sea-ice estimation system, a dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice model has been developed for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). One key requirement is the ability to generate, by means of automatic differentiation (AD), tangent linear (TLM) and adjoint (ADM) model code for the coupled MITgcm ocean/sea-ice system. This second part of a two-part paper describes aspects of the adjoint model. The adjoint ocean and sea-ice model is used to calculate transient sensitivities of solid (ice and snow) freshwater export through Lancaster Sound in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). The adjoint state provides a complementary view of the dynamics. In particular, the transient, multi-year sensitivity patterns reflect dominant pathways and propagation timescales through the CAA as resolved by the model, thus shedding light on causal relationships, in the model, across the Archipelago. The computational cost of inferring such causal relationships from forward model diagnostics alone would be prohibitive. The role of the exact model trajectory around which the adjoint is calculated (and therefore of the exactness of the adjoint) is exposed through calculations using free-slip vs no-slip lateral boundary conditions. Effective ice thickness, sea surface temperature, and precipitation sensitivities, are discussed in detail as examples of the coupled sea-ice/ocean and atmospheric forcing control space. To test the reliability of the adjoint, finite-difference perturbation experiments were performed for each of these elements and the cost perturbations were compared to those “predicted” by the adjoint. Overall, remarkable qualitative and quantitative agreement is found. In particular, the adjoint correctly “predicts” a seasonal sign change in precipitation sensitivities. A physical mechanism for this sign change is presented. The availability of the coupled adjoint opens up the prospect for adjoint-based coupled ocean/sea-ice state estimation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoteit, I</author><author>Cornuelle, B</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An eddy-permitting, dynamically consistent adjoint-based assimilation system for the tropical Pacific: Hindcast experiments in 2000</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>115</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4DVAR</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>tropical Pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JC005437</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hoteit, I., B.

The system uses the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's general circulation model and its adjoint. The adjoint method is used to adjust the model to observations by controlling the initial temperature and salinity; temperature, salinity, and horizontal velocities at the open boundaries; and surface fluxes of momentum, heat, and freshwater. The model is constrained with most of the available data sets in the tropical Pacific, including Tropical Atmosphere and Ocean, ARGO, expendable bathythermograph, and satellite SST and sea surface height data, and climatologies. Results of hindcast experiments in 2000 suggest that the iterated adjoint-based descent is able to significantly improve the model consistency with the multivariate data sets, providing a dynamically consistent realization of the tropical Pacific circulation that generally matches the observations to within specified errors. The estimated model state is evaluated both by comparisons with observations and by checking the controls, the momentum balances, and the representation of small-scale features that were not well sampled by the observations used in the assimilation. As part of these checks, the estimated controls are smoothed and applied in independent model runs to check that small changes in the controls do not greatly change the model hindcast. This is a simple ensemble-based uncertainty analysis. In addition, the original and smoothed controls are applied to a version of the model with doubled horizontal resolution resulting in a broadly similar “downscaled” hindcast, showing that the adjustments are not tuned to a single configuration (meaning resolution, topography, and parameter settings). The time-evolving model state and the adjusted controls should be useful for analysis or to supply the forcing, initial, and boundary conditions for runs of other models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, S G</author><author>Chambers, D P</author><author>Tapley, B D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrological and oceanic effects on polar motion from GRACE and models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><volume>115</volume><keywords><keyword>atmospheric excitation</keyword><keyword>chandler-wobble</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>currents</keyword><keyword>earths variable rotation</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>length</keyword><keyword>seasonal-variations</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009jb006635</electronic-resource-num><notes>Jin, S.

However, quantitative assessment of the hydrological and oceanic effects on polar motion remains unclear because of the lack of global observations. In this paper, hydrological and oceanic mass excitations to polar motion are investigated using monthly TWS and OBP derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) for January 2003 until December 2008. The results from this analysis are compared with hydrological model excitations from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and oceanic model excitations obtained from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) using Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO). Results show that the GRACE-derived OBP and TWS better explain the geodetic residual polar motion excitations for the Px component at the annual period, while the GRACE OBP and ECMWF hydrological angular momentum agree better with the geodetic residuals for the annual Py excitation. GRACE ocean and hydrology excitations better explain the geodetic residuals for the semiannual Py excitation. However, the JPL ECCO and ECMWF models better explain the intraseasonal geodetic residual of polar motion excitation in the Px and Py components. The GRACE data demonstrate much higher intraseasonal variability than either the models or the geodetic observations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Awaji, T</author><author>Balmaseda, M</author><author>Ferry, N</author><author>Fujii, Y</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Giese, B</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Masina, S</author><author>Remy, E</author><author>Rosati, A</author><author>Schodlok, M</author><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Weaver, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Consistency and fidelity of Indonesian-throughflow total volume transport estimated by 14 ocean data assimilation products</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>201-223</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>climate system</keyword><keyword>gcm</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>indonesian throughflow</keyword><keyword>interannual variability</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>ocean data assimilation</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/J.Dynatmoce.2009.12.004</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., and Coauthors, 2010: Consistency and fidelity of Indonesian-throughflow total volume transport estimated by 14 ocean data assimilation products.

The main goals of the comparisons are to examine the consistency and evaluate the skill of different ODA products in simulating ITF transport. The ensemble averaged, time-mean value of ODA estimates is 13.6 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3)/s) for the common 1993-2001 period and 13.9 Sv for the 2004-2006 INSTANT Program period. These values are close to the 15-Sv estimate derived from INSTANT observations. All hut one ODA time-mean estimate fall within the range of uncertainty of the INSTANT estimate. In terms of temporal variability, the scatter among different ODA estimates averaged over time is 1.7 Sv, which is substantially smaller than the magnitude of the temporal variability simulated by the ODA systems. Therefore, the overall &quot;signal-to-noise&quot; ratio for the ensemble estimates is larger than one. The best consistency among the products occurs on seasonal-to-interannual time scales, with generally stronger (weaker) ITF during boreal summer (winter) and during La Nina (El Nino) events. The scatter among different products for seasonal-to-interannual time scales is approximately 1 Sv. Despite the good consistency, systematic difference is found between most ODA products and the INSTANT observations. All but the highest-resolution (18 km) ODA product show a dominant annual cycle while the INSTANT estimate and the 18-km product exhibit a strong semi-annual signal. The coarse resolution is an important factor that limits the level of agreement between ODA and INSTANT estimates. Decadal signals with periods of 10-15 years are seen. The most conspicuous and consistent decadal change is a relatively sharp increase in ITF transport during 1993-2000 associated with the strengthening tropical Pacific trade wind. Most products do not show a weakening ITF after the mid-1970s' associated with the weakened Pacific trade wind. The scatter of ODA estimates is smaller after than before 1980, reflecting the impact of the enhanced observations after the 1980s. To assess the representativeness of using the average over a three-year period (e.g., the span of the INSTANT Program) to describe longer-term mean, we investigate the temporal variations of the three-year low-pass ODA estimates. The average variation is about 3.6 Sv, which is largely due to the increase of ITF transport from 1993 to 2000. However, the three-year average during the 2004-2006 INSTANT Program period is within 0.5 Sv of the long-term mean for the past few decades. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Ice mechanics follow a viscous-plastic rheology and the ice momentum equations are solved numerically using either line-successive-over-relaxation (LSOR) or elastic–viscous-plastic (EVP) dynamic models. Ice thermodynamics are represented using either a zero-heat-capacity formulation or a two-layer formulation that conserves enthalpy. The model includes prognostic variables for snow thickness and for sea ice salinity. The above sea ice model components were borrowed from current generation climate models but they were reformulated on an Arakawa C grid in order to match the MITgcm oceanic grid and they were modified in many ways to permit efficient and accurate automatic differentiation. Both stress tensor divergence and advective terms are discretized with the finite-volume method. The choice of the dynamic solver has a considerable effect on the solution; this effect can be larger than, for example, the choice of lateral boundary conditions, of ice rheology, and of ice-ocean stress coupling. The solutions obtained with different dynamic solvers typically differ by a few cm s−1 in ice drift speeds, 50 cm in ice thickness, and order 200 km3 yr−1 in freshwater (ice and snow) export out of the Arctic.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Eddy-Permitting Southern Ocean State Estimate</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>880-899</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Eddies</keyword><keyword>Meridional</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2009JPO4236.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mazloff, M.

Data used include Argo float profiles, CTD synoptic sections, Southern Elephant Seals as Oceanographic Samplers (SEaOS) instrument-mounted seal profiles, XBTs, altimetric observations [Envisat, Geosat, Jason-1, and Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon], and infrared and microwave radiometer observed sea surface temperature. An adjoint model is used to determine descent directions in minimizing a misfit function, each of whose elements has been weighted by an estimate of the observational plus model error. The model is brought into near agreement with the data by adjusting its control vector, here consisting of initial and meteorological boundary conditions. Although total consistency has not yet been achieved, the existing solution is in good agreement with the great majority of the 2005 and 2006 Southern Ocean observations and better represents these data than does the World Ocean Atlas 2001 (WOA01) climatological product. The estimate captures the oceanic temporal variability and in this respect represents a major improvement upon earlier static inverse estimates. During the estimation period, the Drake Passage volume transport is 153 ± 5 Sv (1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1). The Ross and Weddell polar gyre transports are 20 ± 5 Sv and 40 ± 8 Sv, respectively. Across 32°S there is a surface meridional overturning cell of 12 ± 12 Sv, an intermediate cell of 17 ± 12 Sv, and an abyssal cell of 13 ± 6 Sv. The northward heat and freshwater anomaly transports across 30°S are −0.3 PW and 0.7 Sv, with estimated uncertainties of 0.5 PW and 0.2 Sv. The net rate of wind work is 2.1 ± 1.1 TW. Southern Ocean theories involving short temporal- and spatial-scale dynamics may now be tested with a dynamically and thermodynamically realistic general circulation model solution that is known to be compatible with the modern observational datasets.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Zhang, H</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>M.

In the model, the structure of the marine phytoplankton community self-assembles from a large number of potentially viable physiologies. Amongst them, analogs of Trichodesmium, unicellular diazotrophs and diatom-diazotroph associations (DDA) are successful and abundant. The simulated biogeography and nitrogen fixation rates of the modeled diazotrophs compare favorably with a compilation of published observations, which includes both traditional and molecular measurements of abundance and activity of marine diazotrophs. In the model, the diazotroph analogs occupy warm subtropical and tropical waters, with higher concentrations and nitrogen fixation rates in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Arabian Sea/Northern Indian Ocean, and lower values in the tropical and subtropical South Pacific Ocean. The three main diazotroph types typically co-exist in the model, although Trichodesmium analogs dominate the diazotroph population in much of the North and tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Arabian Sea, while unicellular-diazotroph analogs dominate in the South Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. This pattern reflects the relative degree of nutrient limitation by iron or phosphorus. The model suggests in addition that unicellular diazotrophs could add as much new nitrogen to the global ocean as Trichodesmium.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saba, Vincent S</author><author>Friedrichs, Marjorie A M</author><author>Carr, Mary-Elena</author><author>Antoine, David</author><author>Armstrong, Robert A</author><author>Asanuma, Ichio</author><author>Aumont, Olivier</author><author>Bates, Nicholas R</author><author>Behrenfeld, Michael J</author><author>Bennington, Val</author><author>Bopp, Laurent</author><author>Bruggeman, Jorn</author><author>Buitenhuis, Erik T</author><author>Church, Matthew J</author><author>Ciotti, Aurea M</author><author>Doney, Scott C</author><author>Dowell, Mark</author><author>Dunne, John</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Gregg, Watson</author><author>Hoepffner, Nicolas</author><author>Hyde, Kimberly J W</author><author>Ishizaka, Joji</author><author>Kameda, Takahiko</author><author>Karl, David M</author><author>Lima, Ivan</author><author>Lomas, Michael W</author><author>Marra, John</author><author>McKinley, Galen A</author><author>Mélin, Frédéric</author><author>Moore, J Keith</author><author>Morel, André</author><author>O'Reilly, John</author><author>Salihoglu, Baris</author><author>Scardi, Michele</author><author>Smyth, Tim J</author><author>Tang, Shilin</author><author>Tjiputra, Jerry</author><author>Uitz, Julia</author><author>Vichi, Marcello</author><author>Waters, Kirk</author><author>Westberry, Toby K</author><author>Yool, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Challenges of modeling depth-integrated marine primary productivity over multiple decades: A case study at BATS and HOT</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>24</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4277 Time series experiments</keyword><keyword>4513 Decadal ocean variability</keyword><keyword>4815 Ecosystems, structure, dynamics, and modeling</keyword><keyword>BATS HOT trends</keyword><keyword>marine primary productivity models</keyword><keyword>multidecadal climate forcing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009GB003655</electronic-resource-num><notes>Saba, V.

Specifically, skill was assessed based on the models' ability to estimate the observed mean, variability, and trends of NPP. At both sites, more than 90% of the models underestimated mean NPP, with the average bias of the BOGCMs being nearly twice that of the ocean color models. However, the difference in overall skill between the best BOGCM and the best ocean color model at each site was not significant. Between 1989 and 2007, in situ NPP at BATS and HOT increased by an average of nearly 2% per year and was positively correlated to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index. The majority of ocean color models produced in situ NPP trends that were closer to the observed trends when chlorophyll-a was derived from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), rather than fluorometric or SeaWiFS data. However, this was a function of time such that average trend magnitude was more accurately estimated over longer time periods. Among BOGCMs, only two individual models successfully produced an increasing NPP trend (one model at each site). We caution against the use of models to assess multiannual changes in NPP over short time periods. Ocean color model estimates of NPP trends could improve if more high quality HPLC chlorophyll-a time series were available.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Gao, S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Fine, R A</author><author>Lindstrom, E J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Obduction of Equatorial 13 degrees C Water in the Pacific Identified by a Simulated Passive Tracer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2282-2297</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>annual cycle</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>costa-rica dome</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>eastern tropical pacific</keyword><keyword>indonesian throughflow</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>subsurface countercurrents</keyword><keyword>tsuchiya jet</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2010jpo4358.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Qu, T.

Approximately two-thirds of this obduction occurs within 10 years after the 13 degrees C Water being initialized, with the upper portion of the water mass reaching the surface mixed layer in only about a month. The obduction of the 13 degrees C Water helps to maintain a cool sea surface temperature year-round, equivalent to a surface heat flux of about -6.0 W m(-2) averaged over the eastern tropical Pacific (15 degrees S-15 degrees N, 130 degrees W-eastern boundary) for the period of integration (1993-2006). During El Nino years, when the thermocline deepens as a consequence of the easterly wind weakening, the obduction of the 13 degrees C Water is suppressed, and the reduced vertical entrainment generates a warming anomaly of up to 10 W m(-2) in the eastern tropical Pacific and in particular along the coast of Peru, providing explanations for the warming of sea surface temperature that cannot be accounted for by local winds alone. The situation is reversed during La Nina years.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Awaji, T</author><author>Balmaseda, M</author><author>Behringer, D</author><author>Carton, J</author><author>Ferry, N</author><author>Fischer, A</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Giese, B</author><author>Haines, K</author><author>Harrison, E</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Kamachi, M</author><author>Keppenne, C</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Masina, S</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Ponte, R</author><author>Remy, E</author><author>Rienecker, M</author><author>Rosati, A</author><author>Schroter, J</author><author>Smith, D</author><author>Weaver, A</author><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Xue, Y</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hall, J</author><author>Harrison, D E</author><author>Stammer, D</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Information Provided Through Ensemble Ocean Syntheses</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society (Vol. 2)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society (Vol. 2)</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>Venice, Italy, 21-25 September 2009</pub-location><publisher>ESA Publication WPP-306</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5270/OceanObs09.cwp.85</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., and Coauthors, 2010: Ocean Information Provided Through Ensemble Ocean Syntheses.

However, the global average amplitude of this annual cycle (observed amplitude of ∼8 mm) is not representative of the effects that would be observed at individual tide gauges or at ocean bottom pressure recorders because of self-attraction and loading effects (SAL). In this paper, we examine the spatial variation of sea level change caused by the three main components that load the Earth and contribute to the water cycle: hydrology (including snow), the atmosphere, and the dynamic ocean. The SAL effects cause annual amplitudes at tide gauges (modeled here with a global average of ∼9 mm) to vary from less than 2 mm to more than 18 mm. We find a variance reduction (global average of 3 to 4%) after removing the modeled time series from a global set of tide gauges. We conclude that SAL effects are significant in places (e.g., the south central Pacific and coastal regions in Southeast Asia and west central Africa) and should be considered when interpreting these data sets and using them to constrain ocean circulation models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Werf, P M</author><author>van Leeuwen, P J</author><author>Ridderinkhof, H</author><author>de Ruijter, W P M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison between observations and models of the Mozambique Channel transport: Seasonal cycle and eddy frequencies</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>115</volume><issue>C2</issue><keywords><keyword>0550 Model verification and validation</keyword><keyword>4277 Time series experiments</keyword><keyword>4512 Currents</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>Indian Ocean</keyword><keyword>Mozambique Channel</keyword><keyword>comparison observations and models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JC005633</electronic-resource-num><notes>van der Werf, P.

In the observations, the seasonal cycle cannot be distinguished from red noise, while this cycle is dominant in the transport of the numerical models. It is found, however, that the seasonal cycles of the observations and numerical models are similar in strength and phase. These cycles have an amplitude of 5 Sv and a maximum in September, and can be explained by the yearly variation of the wind forcing. The seasonal cycle in the models is dominant because the spectral density at other frequencies is underrepresented. Main deviations from the observations are found at depths shallower than 1500 m and in the 5/y–6/y frequency range. Nevertheless, the structure of eddies in the models is close to the observed eddy structure. The discrepancy is found to be related to the formation mechanism and the formation position of the eddies. In the observations, eddies are frequently formed from an overshooting current near the mooring section, as proposed by Ridderinkhof and de Ruijter (2003) and Harlander et al. (2009). This causes an alternation of events at the mooring section, varying between a strong southward current, and the formation and passing of an eddy. This results in a large variation of transport in the frequency range of 5/y–6/y. In the models, the eddies are formed further north and propagate through the section. No alternation similar to the observations is observed, resulting in a more constant transport.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, Nadya T</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Tamisiea, Mark E</author><author>Davis, James L</author><author>Hill, Emma M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of self-attraction and loading on annual variations of ocean bottom pressure</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>115</volume><issue>C6</issue><keywords><keyword>0438 Diel, seasonal, and annual cycles</keyword><keyword>1222 Ocean monitoring with geodetic techniques</keyword><keyword>1223 Ocean/Earth/atmosphere/hydrosphere/cryosphere</keyword><keyword>4263 Ocean predictability and prediction</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>annual cycle</keyword><keyword>ocean bottom pressure</keyword><keyword>self-attraction and loading effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JC005783</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vinogradova, N.

The SAL-related changes in ξ occur as a result of deformation of the crust due to loading and self-gravitation of the variable fluid loads. In the absence of SAL, net freshwater input and changes in mean atmospheric pressure over the ocean give rise to a spatially constant ξ annual cycle with an amplitude ∼1–2 cm in equivalent water thickness. Consideration of SAL physics introduces spatial variations that can be significant, particularly around continental boundaries, where the amplitude of deviations can exceed 1 cm. For the spatial variability induced by SAL effects, changes in both land hydrology and atmospheric pressure are important. Effects related to the changing ocean circulation are relatively weaker, apart from a few shallow coastal regions. Comparisons with a few in situ, deep ocean observations indicate that for the most accurate ξ estimates, one needs to consider spatially varying SAL-related signals, along with the effects of mean atmospheric pressure and net freshwater input into the oceans. Nevertheless, the most complete estimates, including also effects of ocean circulation, are able to account for only ∼1/3 of the observed annual variances. Sources of the remaining contribution remain unclear.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Reasons for the Formation and Variability of the Azores Current</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2197-2220</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Currents,Gyres,Mediterranean Sea</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2010JPO4326.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

As the denser Mediterranean water descends down the continental slope, it entrains overlying North Atlantic Central Water. It is believed that the Azores Current then forms as part of the horizontal recirculating gyre generated through the β-plume mechanism. In this study, the authors further explore this hypothesis by performing a series of numerical experiments. These experiments are based on a high-resolution general circulation model that includes the Mediterranean Sea and that realistically simulates the water mass exchange through the Strait of Gibraltar and the transport and variability of the Azores Current. The authors show that the divergence of the relative vorticity flux and the planetary vorticity flux, associated with planetary waves, are the main factors determining the variability of the Azores Current. It is shown experimentally that the closure of the Strait of Gibraltar leads to a complete disappearance of the Azores Current. On the other hand, with the open Strait of Gibraltar, the Azores Current persists even when the wind forcing over the region is turned off. The atmospheric forcing is thus not responsible for the formation of the Azores Current, but it affects the variability of the current with a minor effect on its magnitude. Numerical experiments suggest that the strength and the variability of the Azores Current depend on the magnitude of the water mass exchange through the Strait of Gibraltar but not on its seasonal variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author><author>Lee, Tong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of the meridional heat transport in the Southern Ocean</title><secondary-title>Ocean Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>791-801</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10236-010-0288-0</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

A global ocean data synthesis product at eddy-permitting resolution from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2) project is used to estimate the meridional heat transport (MHT) in the SO and to analyze its mechanisms. Despite the intense eddy activity, we demonstrate that most of the poleward MHT in the SO is due to the time-mean fields of the meridional velocity, V, and potential temperature, θ. This is because the mean circulation in the SO is not strictly zonal. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current carries warm waters from the region south of the Agulhas Retroflection to the lower latitudes of the Drake Passage and the Malvinas Current carries cold waters northward along the Argentinian shelf. Correlations between the time-varying fields of V and θ (defined as transient processes) significantly contribute to the horizontal-gyre heat transport, but not the overturning heat transport. In the highly energetic regions of the Agulhas Retroflection and the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence the contribution of the horizontal transient processes to the total MHT exceeds the contribution of the mean horizontal flow. We show that the southward total MHT is mainly maintained by the meridional excursion of the mean geostrophic horizontal shear flow (i.e., deviation from the zonal average) associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that balances the equatorward MHT due to the Ekman transport and provides a net poleward MHT in the SO. The Indian sector of the SO serves as the main pathway for the poleward MHT.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, W Q</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimates of global ocean volume transports during 1960 through 2001</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>37</volume><keywords><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>deep</keyword><keyword>drake passage</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>hydrographic data</keyword><keyword>mass</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010gl043949</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wang, W.

Here, satellite observations of sea surface height (SSH) along with temperature, salinity and velocity from profiling floats are used to estimate changes in the northward-flowing, upper limb of the AMOC at latitudes around 41°N. The 2004 through 2006 mean overturning is found to be 15.5 ± 2.4 Sv (106 m3/s) with somewhat smaller seasonal and interannual variability than at lower latitudes. There is no significant trend in overturning strength between 2002 and 2009. Altimeter data, however, suggest an increase of 2.6 Sv since 1993, consistent with North Atlantic warming during this same period. Despite significant seasonal to interannual fluctuations, these observations demonstrate that substantial slowing of the AMOC did not occur during the past 7 years and is unlikely to have occurred in the past 2 decades.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of the Indo-Pacific Ocean exchanges</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>157-173</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ITF</keyword><keyword>Indonesian Seas</keyword><keyword>Ocean general circulation</keyword><keyword>State estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2009.12.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2010: Variability of the Indo-Pacific Ocean exchanges.

These data are used to construct a purely empirical and analytical frequency–zonal wavenumber spectrum of ocean variability for periods between about 20 days and 15 yr and on spatial scales of about 200–10 000 km. The spectrum is dominated by motions along a “nondispersive” line, which is a robust feature of the data but for whose prominence a complete theoretical explanation is not available. The estimated spectrum also contains significant energy at all frequencies and wavenumbers in this range, including eastward-propagating motions, which are likely some combination of nonlinear spectral cascades, wave propagation, and wind-forced motions. The spectrum can be used to calculate statistical expectations of spatial average sea level and transport variations. However, because the statistics of trend determination in quantities such as sea level and volume transports depend directly upon the spectral limit of the frequency approaching zero, the appropriate significance calculations remain beyond reach, because low-frequency variability is indistinguishable from trends already present in the data.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hall, J</author><author>Harrison, D E</author><author>Stammer, D</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Observational network design for climate</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society (Vol. 1)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society (Vol. 1)</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>Venice, Italy, 21-25 September 2009</pub-location><publisher>ESA Publication WPP-306</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5270/OceanObs09.pp.41</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2010: Observational network design for climate.

Initial temperature and salinity perturbations leading to an optimal growth of tropical SST anomalies, typically arising from the nonnormal dynamics, are evaluated. The structure of the optimal perturbations is characterized by relatively strong deep salinity anomalies near the western boundary generating a transient amplification of equatorial SST anomalies in less than four years. The associated growth mechanism is linked to the excitation of coastal and equatorial Kelvin waves near the western boundary following a rapid geostrophic adjustment owing to the optimal initial temperature and salinity perturbations. The results suggest that the nonnormality of the ocean dynamics may efficiently create large tropical SST variability on interannual time scales in the Atlantic without the participation of air–sea processes or the meridional overturning circulation. An optimal deep initial salinity perturbation of 0.1 ppt located near the western boundary can result in a tropical SST anomaly of approximately 0.45°C after nearly four years, assuming the dynamics are linear. Possible mechanisms for exciting such deep perturbations are discussed. While this study is motivated by tropical Atlantic SST variability, its relevance to other basins is not excluded. The optimal initial conditions leading to the tropical SST anomalies’ growth are obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. The evaluation of the optimals is achieved by using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) tangent linear and adjoint models as well the the Arnoldi Package (ARPACK) software for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baehr, J</author><author>Cunnningham, S</author><author>Haak, H</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Kanzow, T</author><author>Marotzke, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observed and simulated estimates of the meridional overturning circulation at 26.5-deg N in the Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Ocean Sci.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Sci.</full-title></periodical><pages>575-589</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/os-5-575-2009</electronic-resource-num><notes>Baehr, J., S.

At 1/6° (∼18 km) resolution the model resolves the major Arctic transport pathways, including Bering Strait and the Canadian Archipelago. Two main calculations are performed by repeating the wind fields of two contrasting NAO years in each run for the extreme negative and positive NAO phases of 1969 and 1989, respectively. These calculations are compared both with a control run and the compiled observationally based freshwater budget estimate of Serreze et al. The results show a clear response in the Arctic freshwater budget to NAO forcing, that is, repeat NAO negative wind forcing results in virtually all freshwater being retained in the Arctic, with the bulk of the freshwater content being pooled in the Beaufort gyre. In contrast, repeat NAO positive forcing accelerates the export of freshwater out of the Arctic to the North Atlantic, primarily via Fram Strait (∼900 km3 yr−1) and the Canadian Archipelago (∼500 km3 yr−1), with a total loss in freshwater storage of ∼13 000 km3 (15%) after 10 yr. The large increase in freshwater export through the Canadian Archipelago highlights the important role that this gateway plays in redistributing the freshwater of the Arctic to subpolar seas, by providing a direct pathway from the Arctic basin to the Labrador Sea, Gulf Stream system, and Atlantic Ocean. The authors discuss the sensitivity of the Arctic Ocean to long-term fixed extreme NAO states and show that the freshwater content of the Arctic is able to be restored to initial values from a depleted freshwater state after ∼20 yr.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cummings, J</author><author>Bertino, L</author><author>Brasseur, P</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Kamachi, M</author><author>Martin, M J</author><author>Mogensen, K</author><author>Oke, P</author><author>Testut, C E</author><author>Verron, J</author><author>Weaver, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Data Assimilation Systems for Godae</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>96-109</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>kalman filter</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>salinity</keyword><keyword>smoother</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2009.69</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cummings, J., and Coauthors, 2009: Ocean Data Assimilation Systems for Godae.

We discuss assimilation methods, observations assimilated, and techniques used to specify error covariances.

In this study, the sensitivity of the solution to the constraints provided by various datasets is investigated in a regional setting in the North Pacific. Four assimilation experiments are performed, which vary by the data used as constraints and the relative weights associated with these data. The resulting estimates are compared to two of the assimilated datasets as well as to data from two time series stations not used as constraints. These comparisons demonstrate that increasing the weights of the subsurface data provides overall improvement in the model–data consistency of the estimate of the state of the North Pacific Ocean. However, some elements of the solution are degraded. This could result from incompatibility between datasets, possibly because of hidden biases, or from errors in the model physics made more evident by the increased weight on subsurface data. The adjustments to the control parameters of surface forcing and initial conditions necessary to obtain the more accurate fit to the data are found to be within prior error bars.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, B D</author><author>Worcester, P F</author><author>Munk, W H</author><author>Spindel, R C</author><author>Mercer, J A</author><author>Howe, B M</author><author>Metzger, K</author><author>Birdsall, T G</author><author>Andrew, R K</author><author>Dzieciuch, M A</author><author>Cornuelle, B D</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A decade of acoustic thermometry in the North Pacific Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>114</volume><issue>C7</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4259 Ocean acoustics</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4263 Ocean predictability and prediction</keyword><keyword>acoustic thermometry</keyword><keyword>basin-scale variability</keyword><keyword>model testing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC005124</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dushaw, B.

The acoustic travel times are inherently spatially integrating, which suppresses mesoscale variability and provides a precise measure of ray-averaged temperature. Daily average travel times at 4-day intervals provide excellent temporal resolution of the large-scale thermal field. The interannual, seasonal, and shorter-period variability is large, with substantial changes sometimes occurring in only a few weeks. Linear trends estimated over the decade are small compared to the interannual variability and inconsistent from path to path, with some acoustic paths warming slightly and others cooling slightly. The measured travel times are compared with travel times derived from four independent estimates of the North Pacific: (1) climatology, as represented by the World Ocean Atlas 2005 (WOA05); (2) objective analysis of the upper-ocean temperature field derived from satellite altimetry and in situ profiles; (3) an analysis provided by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean project, as implemented at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL-ECCO); and (4) simulation results from a high-resolution configuration of the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) model. The acoustic data show that WOA05 is a better estimate of the time mean hydrography than either the JPL-ECCO or the POP estimates, both of which proved incapable of reproducing the observed acoustic arrival patterns. The comparisons of time series provide a stringent test of the large-scale temperature variability in the models. The differences are sometimes substantial, indicating that acoustic thermometry data can provide significant additional constraints for numerical ocean models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Follows, M J</author><author>Bragg, J G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling the coupling of ocean ecology and biogeochemistry</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modelin</keyword><keyword>4815 Ecosystems, structure, dynamics, and modeling</keyword><keyword>4858 Population dynamics and ecology</keyword><keyword>ecology</keyword><keyword>ocean biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>resource competition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008GB003405</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dutkiewicz, S., M.

We consider the complex model solutions in the light of resource competition theory. The emergent community structures and ecological regimes vary across different physical environments in the model ocean: Strongly seasonal, high-nutrient regions are dominated by fast growing bloom specialists, while stable, low-seasonality regions are dominated by organisms that can grow at low nutrient concentrations and are suited to oligotrophic conditions. In the latter regions, the framework of resource competition theory provides a useful qualitative and quantitative diagnostic tool with which to interpret the outcome of competition between model organisms, their regulation of the resource environment, and the sensitivity of the system to changes in key physiological characteristics of the cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferrari, Raffaele</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Circulation Kinetic Energy: Reservoirs, Sources, and Sinks</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics</full-title></periodical><pages>253-282</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>energy spectrum,geostrophic eddies,internal waves,</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev.fluid.40.111406.102139</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ferrari, R., and C.

Although the wind field produces a large energy input to the ocean, all but approximately 10% appears to be dissipated within about 100 m of the sea surface, rendering observations of the energy divergence necessary to maintain the full water-column flow difficult. Attention thus shifts to the physically different kinetic energy (KE) reservoirs of the circulation and their maintenance, dissipation, and possible influence on the very small scales representing irreversible molecular mixing. Oceanic KE is dominated by the geostrophic eddy field, and depending on the vertical structure (barotropic versus low-mode baroclinic), direct and inverse energy cascades are possible. The pathways toward dissipation of the dominant geostrophic eddy KE depend crucially on the direction of the cascade but are difficult to quantify because of serious observational difficulties for wavelengths shorter than approximately 100–200 km. At high frequencies, KE is dominated by internal waves with near-inertial frequencies (frequencies near the local Coriolis parameter), whose shears appear to be a major source of wave breaking and mixing in the ocean interior.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gruber, Nicolas</author><author>Gloor, Manuel</author><author>Mikaloff Fletcher, Sara E</author><author>Doney, Scott C</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J</author><author>Gerber, Markus</author><author>Jacobson, Andrew R</author><author>Joos, Fortunat</author><author>Lindsay, Keith</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mouchet, Anne</author><author>Müller, Simon A</author><author>Sarmiento, Jorge L</author><author>Takahashi, Taro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic sources, sinks, and transport of atmospheric CO2</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>23</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>0414 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modelin</keyword><keyword>0428 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>0460 Marine systems</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>air-sea carbon flux</keyword><keyword>anthropogenic CO2</keyword><keyword>carbon flux</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008GB003349</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gruber, N., and Coauthors, 2009: Oceanic sources, sinks, and transport of atmospheric CO2.

These two independent flux estimates reveal a consistent description of the regional distribution of annual mean sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2 for the decade of the 1990s and the early 2000s with differences at the regional level of generally less than 0.1 Pg C a−1. This distribution is characterized by outgassing in the tropics, uptake in midlatitudes, and comparatively small fluxes in thehigh latitudes. Both estimates point toward a small (∼ −0.3 Pg C a−1) contemporary CO2 sink in the Southern Ocean (south of 44°S), a result of the near cancellation between a substantial outgassing of natural CO2 and a strong uptake of anthropogenic CO2. A notable exception in the generally good agreement between the two estimates exists within the Southern Ocean: the ocean inversion suggests a relatively uniform uptake, while the pCO2-based estimate suggests strong uptake in the region between 58°S and 44°S, and a source in the region south of 58°S. Globally and for a nominal period between 1995 and 2000, the contemporary net air-sea flux of CO2 is estimated to be −1.7 ± 0.4 Pg C a−1 (inversion) and −1.4 ± 0.7 Pg C a−1 (pCO2-climatology), respectively, consisting of an outgassing flux of river-derived carbon of ∼+0.5 Pg C a−1, and an uptake flux of anthropogenic carbon of −2.2 ± 0.3 Pg C a−1 (inversion) and −1.9 ± 0.7 Pg C a−1 (pCO2-climatology). The two flux estimates also imply a consistent description of the contemporary meridional transport of carbon with southward ocean transport throughout most of the Atlantic basin, and strong equatorward convergence in the Indo-Pacific basins. Both transport estimates suggest a small hemispheric asymmetry with a southward transport of between −0.2 and −0.3 Pg C a−1 across the equator. While the convergence of these two independent estimates is encouraging and suggests that it is now possible to provide relatively tight constraints for the net air-sea CO2 fluxes at the regional basis, both studies are limited by their lack of consideration of long-term changes in the ocean carbon cycle, such as the recent possible stalling in the expected growth of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pattern and velocity of propagation of the global ocean eddy variability</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>114</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>4512 Currents</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4562 Topographic/bathymetric interactions</keyword><keyword>ocean eddy</keyword><keyword>propagation velocity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JC005349</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fu, L.-L., 2009: Pattern and velocity of propagation of the global ocean eddy variability.

Decade-long time series of sea surface height is analyzed for finding the maximum cross correlation with neighboring time series within a window of space and time lags. The space and time lags corresponding to the maximum correlation allow an estimate of the propagation velocity of the eddy variability that dominates the variance of sea surface height anomalies. The method cannot distinguish the various forms of eddy variability: isolated eddies and fronts, the meandering of ocean currents, or planetary waves. However, the results provide, at a given location of the global oceans, a uniquely determined propagation velocity that represents a time-averaged description of the tendency of the movement of the local eddy variability. The propagation velocity is highly inhomogeneous in space. Outside the equatorial zone, the zonal propagation is intrinsically westward, modified by ocean currents, which could reverse the zonal propagation to eastward in regions like the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. At midlatitudes and high latitudes, the propagation pattern is highly affected by the path of ocean currents and the shape of bottom topography. At tropical latitudes, the meridional propagation is convergent toward the equator in the western basins and divergent away from the equator in the eastern basins. Comparison with the simulations of an eddy-permitting ocean general circulation model shows overall agreement, especially in the latitudinal variation of the zonal propagation velocity. The result suggests that the model has captured the essence of the dynamics governing the propagation of ocean eddy variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Bugnion, Véronique</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Greenland ice-sheet volume sensitivity to basal, surface and initial conditions derived from an adjoint model</title><secondary-title>Annals of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>67-80</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>52</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/172756409789624256</electronic-resource-num><notes>Heimbach, P., and V.

Lagrange multipliers, i.e. sensitivities, are computed with an exact, efficient adjoint model that has been generated from SICOPOLIS by rigorous application of automatic differentiation. The case study uses the adjoint model to determine the sensitivity of the total Greenland ice volume to various control variables over a 100 year period. The control space has of the order 1.2 × 10&lt;sup xmlns=&quot;http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/&quot;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; elements, consisting of spatial fields of basal flow parameters, surface and basal forcings and initial conditions. Reliability of the adjoint model was tested through finite-difference perturbation calculations for various control variables and perturbation regions, ascertaining quantitative inferences of the adjoint model. As well as confirming qualitative aspects of ice-sheet sensitivities (e.g. expected regional variations), we detect regions where model sensitivities are seemingly unexpected or counter-intuitive, albeit 'real' in the sense of actual model behavior. An example is inferred regions where sensitivities of ice-sheet volume to basal sliding coefficient are positive, i.e. where a local increase in basal sliding parameter &lt;i xmlns=&quot;http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/&quot;&gt;increases&lt;/i&gt; the ice-sheet volume. Similarly, positive (generally negative) ice temperature sensitivities in certain parts of the ice sheet are found, the detection of which seems highly unlikely if only conventional perturbation experiments had been used. The object of this paper is largely a proof of concept. Available adjoint-code generation tools now open up a variety of novel model applications, notably with regard to sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and ice-sheet state estimation or data assimilation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halkides, D J</author><author>Lee, Tong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms controlling seasonal-to-interannual mixed layer temperature variability in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>114</volume><issue>C2</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>IOZDM</keyword><keyword>MLT</keyword><keyword>SETIO</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC004949</electronic-resource-num><notes>Halkides, D.

We examine spatial inhomogeneity of the SETIO MLT budget, contrasting three subregions with different forcing/circulation characteristics to better understand the area mean budget over the full SETIO. The subregions are the equatorial zone (box 1), the Sumatra-Java upwelling zone (box 2), and east of the thermocline ridge (box 3). Seasonally, surface heat flux dominates MLT in all regions; advection and subsurface processes generally play secondary roles. On interannual scales, surface heat flux makes major contributions in all three boxes to termination of SETIO cooling associated with the Indian Ocean Zonal/Dipole Mode. Ocean dynamics show vital differences between regions: Subsurface processes cool box 1 and 2 but warm box 3. Horizontal advection warms box 1 but cools box 2 and 3. Averaging the MLT budget over the SETIO obscures regional physics. We explain spatial variations of the SETIO MLT budget in terms of differences in forcing, circulation, MLT distribution, and mixed layer and barrier layer thicknesses. We also examine SETIO MLT budget differences during 1994, 1997, and 2006, years exhibiting notable SETIO cooling events. In box 1, horizontal advection dominates warming after the 1994 and 2006 coolings, while in 1997, surface heat flux dominates warming. In box 2, cooling peaks earlier in 1994 than in 1997 and 2006 because of subsurface processes. Last, we show that the MLT budget is very different from heat budgets for fixed depth layers (e.g., the top 50–60 m).</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kroner, C</author><author>Thomas, M</author><author>Dobslaw, H</author><author>Abe, M</author><author>Weise, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal effects of non-tidal oceanic mass shifts in observations with superconducting gravimeters</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>354-359</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>3-5</issue><keywords><keyword>GRACE validation</keyword><keyword>Long-periodic gravity variations</keyword><keyword>Ocean models</keyword><keyword>Superconducting gravimetry</keyword><keyword>atmospheric-pressure</keyword><keyword>earth</keyword><keyword>field</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>ground gravity measurements</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>parameters</keyword><keyword>reduction</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword><keyword>validation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jog.2009.09.009</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kroner, C., M.

At the same time evidence needs to be provided that these reductions are both necessary and sufficient. Based on the OMCT and the ECCO model the gravity effect of non-tidal oceanic mass shifts is computed for various sites equipped with a superconducting gravimeter (SG) and esp. the long-periodic contributions are studied. With these oceanic models the dynamic ocean response to atmospheric pressure loading is automatically computed, and thus goes beyond the more simplistic concepts of an inverted barometer, or alternately a rigid ocean, which is a clear advantage. The findings so far are ambiguous: for instance the systematic seasonal change of about 10 nm/s(2) in gravity for mid-European stations is presently not found in the observed gravity variations. Generally, the order of magnitude of the total effect of 22-27 nm/s(2) is surprisingly large for inland stations. in some data sections the reduction leads to the removal of some of the larger residuals. The results obtained for the South-African station Sutherland differ. Here the modelled seasonal variation caused by the non-tidal oceanic mass redistribution and gravity residuals generally correlate, and thus by the reduction an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio in the gravity observations is achieved. An explanation for the different results might be found in the global hydrological models. Such a model is needed in order to remove the effect of large-scale variations in continental water storage in the gravity observations. This reduction plays a greater role for European stations than for the South African site. A critical impact of the land-sea-mask used in the oceanic models and the subsequent insufficient resolution of the North and Baltic Sea on the computations at the mid-European sites could not be confirmed. From a comparison between the OMCT and the ECCO model substantial discrepancies in some regions of the earth emerge, while both predict variations at inland stations in Europe, South Africa, and Asia of similar magnitude. We currently hesitate to recommend including this reduction in the routine processing of SG data because the seasonal order of magnitude for inland stations is unexpectedly large and partly significant deviations between the modelled oceanic effects exist. if the order of magnitude proves to be correct universally, this reduction has to be applied.

Numerical models of the circulation and biogeochemical cycles of the region can help to interpret and extrapolate the data and may ultimately be applied in global change sensitivity studies. Here we develop and explore a regional, three-dimensional model of the Arctic Ocean in which, for the first time, we explicitly represent the sources of riverine DOC with seasonal discharge based on climatological field estimates. Through a suite of numerical experiments, we explore the distribution of DOC-like tracers with realistic riverine sources and a simple linear decay to represent remineralization through microbial degradation. The model reproduces the slope of the DOC-salinity relationship observed in the eastern and western Arctic basins when the DOC tracer lifetime is about 10 years, consistent with published inferences from field data. The new empirical parameterization of riverine DOC and the regional circulation and biogeochemical model provide new tools for application in both regional and global change studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maze, Guillaume</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Buckley, Martha</author><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Cerovecki, Ivana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Transformation and Formation Maps to Study the Role of Air–Sea Heat Fluxes in North Atlantic Eighteen Degree Water Formation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1818-1835</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Air–sea interaction,Atlantic Ocean,Water masses,Fl</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2009JPO3985.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Maze, G., G.

The divergence of the transformation rate yields the rate at which a given temperature range is created or destroyed by air–sea heat fluxes (formation). Walin’s framework provides a precise integral statement at the expense of losing spatial information. In this study the integrand of Walin’s expression to yield transformation and formation maps is plotted and used to study the role of air–sea heat fluxes in the cycle of formation–destruction of the 18° ± 1°C layer in the North Atlantic. Using remotely sensed sea surface temperatures and air–sea heat flux estimates based on both analyzed meteorological fields and ocean data–model syntheses for the 3-yr period from 2004 to 2006, the authors find that Eighteen Degree Water (EDW) is formed by air–sea heat fluxes in the western part of the subtropical gyre, just south of the Gulf Stream. The formation rate peaks in February when the EDW layer is thickened by convection owing to buoyancy loss. EDW is destroyed by air–sea heat fluxes from spring to summer over the entire subtropical gyre. In the annual mean there is net EDW formation in the west to the south of the Gulf Stream, and net destruction over the eastern part of the gyre. Results suggest that annual mean formation rates of EDW associated with air–sea fluxes are in the range from 3 to 5 Sv (Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1). Finally, error estimates are computed from sea surface temperature and heat flux data using an ensemble perturbation method. The transformation/formation patterns are found to be robust and errors mostly affect integral quantities.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, A T</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Kwok, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved modeling of the Arctic halocline with a subgrid-scale brine rejection parameterization</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>114</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4536 Hydrography and tracers</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>9315 Arctic region</keyword><keyword>brine rejection</keyword><keyword>halocline</keyword><keyword>model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC005121</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nguyen, A.

Modeling the halocline, however, remains a challenge in current state-of-the-art coupled ocean sea ice models including those that participated in the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project. In this study, we successfully reproduce a cold halocline in the Canada Basin by implementing a subgrid-scale brine rejection parameterization in an ocean general circulation model. The brine rejection scheme improves the solution by redistributing surface salts rejected during sea ice formation to their neutral buoyancy depths. The depths are based on salt plume physics and published laboratory and numerical experiments. Compared with hydrographic data from 1993 to 2004, distribution of most of the rejected salt to the bottom of the mixed layer seems to yield the lowest model-data misfits. We also show that the model's mixed layer depth is sensitive to the background diffusivity ν used in the k-profile parameterization vertical mixing scheme. A background diffusivity of 10−6 m2/s in combination with brine rejection scheme described herein yield the best simulation of the Arctic halocline.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rate of Work Done by Atmospheric Pressure on the Ocean General Circulation and Tides</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>458-464</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Ocean circulation,Pressure,Tides</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2008JPO4034.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

The power input by fluctuations in atmospheric pressure pa resulting from the S1 and S2 air tides and the stochastic continuum is analyzed here, with a focus on globally integrated, time-mean values. Results are based on available 1° × 1° near-global pa and sea level fields and are intended as mainly order-of-magnitude estimates. The rate of work done on the radiational and gravitational components of the S2 ocean tide is estimated at 14 and −60 GW, respectively, mostly occurring at low latitudes. The net extraction of energy at a rate of −46 GW is about 10% of available estimates of the work rates by gravity on the S2 tide. For the mainly radiational S1 tide, the power input by pa is much weaker (0.25 GW). Based on daily mean quantities, the stochastic pa continuum contributes ∼3 GW to the nontidal circulation, with substantial power input being associated with the pa-driven dynamic response in the Southern Ocean at submonthly time scales. Missing contributions from nontidal variability at the shortest periods (≤ 2 days) may be substantial, but the rate of work done by pa on the general circulation is likely to remain &lt; 1% of the available wind input estimates. The importance of pa effects when considering local, time-variable energetics remains a possibility, however.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Quinn, Katherine J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bottom pressure changes around Antarctica and wind-driven meridional flows</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>36</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>1217 Time variable gravity</keyword><keyword>1222 Ocean monitoring with geodetic techniques</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>Ekman transport</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>bottom pressure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009GL039060</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

Both GRACE and ECCO results indicate mass exchange primarily between the Southern Ocean and the Pacific and the importance of zonal wind stress to this exchange. The ECCO flow fields show that the near-surface meridional Ekman transport, directly driven by the zonal wind stress, is nearly balanced by return flows below the shallowest topography at 60°S (∼1300 m at this Drake Passage latitude), with the return transport being slightly lagged in time relative to the Ekman transport. Such time lags, which may result from geostrophic adjustment at depth, cause the small associated net transport across 60°S to be ∼90° out of phase with the wind. This in turn can explain why zonal wind stress and bottom pressure anomalies around Antarctica tend to be anticorrelated in both GRACE and ECCO results.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Gao, S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Fine, R A</author><author>Lindstrom, E J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Origin and Pathway of Equatorial 13 degrees C Water in the Pacific Identified by a Simulated Passive Tracer and Its Adjoint</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1836-1853</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>intermediate</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>overturning circulations</keyword><keyword>south-pacific</keyword><keyword>subsurface countercurrents</keyword><keyword>subtropical mode water</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific</keyword><keyword>undercurrent</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2009jpo4045.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Qu, T.

Results demonstrate that the source region of the 13 degrees C Water lies well outside the tropics. In the South Pacific, some 13 degrees C Water is formed northeast of New Zealand, confirming an earlier hypothesis on the water's origin. The South Pacific origin of the 13 degrees C Water is also related to the formation of the Eastern Subtropical Mode Water (ESTMW) and the Sub-Antarctic Mode Water (SAMW). The portion of the ESTMW and SAMW that eventually enters the density range of the 13 degrees C Water (25.8 &lt; sigma(theta) &lt; 26.6 kg m(-3)) does so largely by mixing. Water formed in the subtropics enters the equatorial region predominantly through the western boundary, while its interior transport is relatively small. The fresher North Pacific ESTMW and Central Mode Water (CMW) are also important sources of the 13 degrees C Water. The ratio of the southern versus the northern origins of the water mass is about 2 to 1 and tends to increase with time elapsed from its origin. Of the total volume of initially tracer-tagged water in the eastern equatorial Pacific, approximately 47.5% originates from depths above sigma(theta) = 25.8 kg m(-3) and 34.6% from depths below sigma(theta) = 26.6 kg m(-3), indicative of a dramatic impact of mixing on the route of subtropical water to becoming the 13 degrees C Water. Still only a small portion of the water formed in the subtropics reaches the equatorial region, because most of the water is trapped and recirculates in the subtropical gyre.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sannino, G</author><author>Herrmann, M</author><author>Carillo, A</author><author>Rupolo, V</author><author>Ruggiero, V</author><author>Artale, V</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An eddy-permitting model of the Mediterranean Sea with a two-way grid refinement at the Strait of Gibraltar</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>56-72</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Mediterranean ocean model</keyword><keyword>Strait of Gibraltar</keyword><keyword>Two-way grid refinement</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2009.06.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sannino, G., M.

Within this grid a 1 24 ° resolution model of the Strait of Gibraltar is embedded. The two grids belong to different models that are coupled through an external parallel driver. The robustness of the adopted grid refinement procedure is tested on a multi-decadal integration simulating the present climate. The good agreement found between the model circulation and most of the available observations confirms both the robustness and effectiveness of the two-way grid refinement technique. The effects produced on the Mediterranean circulation by the grid refinement are investigated through the comparison of two simulations differing only in the presence of the grid refinement. Even though the main characteristics of the thermohaline circulation appear similar in the two simulations, some quantitative and qualitative differences are observed: the main differences found in the Strait of Gibraltar propagate into the whole basin, have an impact on the water column stratification, and consequently on the convection events.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Utke, Jean</author><author>Hascoet, Laurent</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Hovland, Paul</author><author>Naumann, Uwe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toward adjoinable MPI</title><secondary-title>2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><keywords><keyword>Computer languages</keyword><keyword>Computer science</keyword><keyword>Cost function</keyword><keyword>Finite difference methods</keyword><keyword>Input variables</keyword><keyword>Laboratories</keyword><keyword>MPI</keyword><keyword>MPI-aware program analysis</keyword><keyword>Numerical models</keyword><keyword>Productivity</keyword><keyword>Protection switching</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity analysis</keyword><keyword>adjoinable MPI</keyword><keyword>application program interfaces</keyword><keyword>automatic differentiation</keyword><keyword>computer program</keyword><keyword>data flow computing</keyword><keyword>message passing</keyword><keyword>parallel communication dataflow</keyword><keyword>productivity tool</keyword><keyword>program diagnostics</keyword><keyword>reverse mode</keyword><keyword>source transformation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4244-3751-1</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161165</electronic-resource-num><notes>Utke, J., L.

Therefore, it is an essential productivity tool in numerous computational science and engineering domains. Computing gradients with the adjoint (also called reverse) mode via source transformation is a particularly beneficial but also challenging use of automatic differentiation. To date only ad hoc solutions for adjoint differentiation of MPI programs have been available, forcing automatic differentiation tool users to reason about parallel communication dataflow and dependencies and manually develop adjoint communication code. Using the communication graph as a model we characterize the principal problems of adjoining the most frequently used communication idioms. We propose solutions to cover these idioms and consider the consequences for the MPI implementation, the MPI user and MPI-aware program analysis. The MIT general circulation model serves as a use case to illustrate the viability of our approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Werf, P M</author><author>Schouten, M W</author><author>van Leeuwen, P J</author><author>Ridderinkhof, H</author><author>de Ruijter, W P M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observation and origin of an interannual salinity anomaly in the Mozambique Channel</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>114</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>4223 Descriptive and regional oceanography</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>Mozambique Channel</keyword><keyword>interannual variability</keyword><keyword>salinity anomaly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC004911</electronic-resource-num><notes>van der Werf, P.

Meanwhile, a moored array is continued from 2003 to 2008. This anomaly was most distinct showing an interannual but nonseasonal variation. The possible origin of the anomaly is investigated using output from three ocean general circulation models (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modeling, and Parallel Ocean Program). The most probable mechanism for the salinity anomaly is the anomalous inflow of subtropical waters caused by a weakening of the northern part of the South Equatorial Current by weaker trade winds. This mechanism was found in all three numerical models. In addition, the numerical models indicate a possible salinization of one of the source water masses to the Mozambique Channel as an additional cause of the anomaly. The anomaly propagated southward into the Agulhas Current and northward along the African coast.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The oceanic variability spectrum and transport trends</title><secondary-title>Atmosphere-Ocean</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Atmosphere-Ocean</full-title></periodical><pages>281-291</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3137/OC310.2009</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2009: The oceanic variability spectrum and transport trends.

A variety of simple theories all produce time scales suggesting that the mid- and high-latitude oceans should respond to atmospheric driving only over several decades. In practice, little change is seen in the MOC and associated heat transport except very close to the sea surface, at depth near the equator, and in parts of the Southern Ocean. Variability in meridional transports in both volume and enthalpy is dominated by the annual cycle and secondarily by the semiannual cycle, particularly in the Southern Ocean. On time scales longer than a year, the solution exhibits small trends with complicated global spatial patterns. Apart from a net uptake of heat from the atmosphere (forced by the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis, which produces net ocean heating), the origins of the meridional transport trends are not distinguishable and are likely a combination of model disequilibrium, shifts in the observing system, other trends (real or artificial) in the meteorological fields, and/or true oceanic secularities. None of the results, however, supports an inference of oceanic circulation shifts taking the system out of the range in which changes are more than small perturbations. That the oceanic observations do not conflict with an apparent excess heat uptake from the atmosphere implies a continued undersampling of the global ocean, even in the upper layers.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The global general circulation of the ocean estimated by the ECCO-Consortium</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>88-103</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>construction</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>sensitivity</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>variational data assimilation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2009.41</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., P.

The time series of the first empirical orthogonal function of the MOC is found to be correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, while the associated circulation anomalies correspond to cells extending over the full ocean depth. Model sensitivity experiments suggest that the wind is responsible for most of this interannual variability, at least south of 40 degrees N. A dynamical decomposition of the meridional streamfunction allows a further look into the mechanisms. In particular, the contributions associated with 1) the Ekman flow and its depth-independent compensation, 2) the vertical shear flow, and 3) the barotropic gyre flowing over zonally varying topography are examined. Ekman processes are found to dominate the shorter time scales (1.5-3 yr), while for longer time scales (3-10 yr) the MOC variations associated with vertical shear flow are of greater importance. The latter is primarily caused by heaving of the pycnocline in the western subtropics associated with the stronger wind forcing. Finally, how these changes in the MOC affect the meridional heat transport (MHT) is examined. It is found that overall, Ekman processes explain a larger part of interannual variability (3-10 yr) for MHT (57%) than for the MOC (33%).</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cazes-Boezio, Gabriel</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mechoso, Carlos R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of ECCO Ocean-State Estimates on the Initialization of Seasonal Climate Forecasts</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>1929-1947</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Hindcasts</keyword><keyword>Model initialization</keyword><keyword>Ocean models</keyword><keyword>Sea surface temperature</keyword><keyword>Seasonal forecasting</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2007JCLI1574.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cazes-Boezio, G., D.

The CGCM consists of the University of California, Los Angeles, Atmospheric GCM (UCLA AGCM) and an ECCO ocean configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology GCM (MITgcm). The forecasts correspond to ensemble seasonal hindcasts for the period 1993–2001. For the forecasts, the ocean component of the CGCM is initialized in either early March or in early June using ocean states provided either by an unconstrained forward ocean integration of the MITgcm (the “baseline” hindcasts) or by data-constrained ECCO results (the “ECCO” hindcasts). Forecast skill for both the baseline and the ECCO hindcasts is significantly higher than persistence and compares well with the skill of other state-of-the art CGCM forecast systems. For March initial conditions, the standard errors of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in ECCO hindcasts (relative to observed anomalies) are up to 1°C smaller than in the baseline hindcasts over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific (150°–120°W). For June initial conditions, the errors of ECCO hindcasts are up to 0.5°C smaller than in the baseline hindcasts. The smaller standard error of the ECCO hindcasts is, in part, due to a more realistic equatorial thermocline structure of the ECCO initial conditions. This study confirms the value of physically consistent ocean-state estimation for the initialization of seasonal climate forecasts.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campin, J M</author><author>Marshall, J</author><author>Ferreira, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sea ice-ocean coupling using a rescaled vertical coordinate z*</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>atmosphere</keyword><keyword>boundary-conditions</keyword><keyword>circulation models</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>conservation</keyword><keyword>formulation</keyword><keyword>free-surface</keyword><keyword>fresh-water flux</keyword><keyword>ocean model</keyword><keyword>sea ice model</keyword><keyword>simulations</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>vertical coordinate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2008.05.005</electronic-resource-num><notes>Campin, J.

This scheme includes the effects of diabatic mesoscale fluxes within the surface layer. The experiments with the new parameterization show significant improvements compared to a control integration that tapers the effects of the eddies as the surface is approached. Such surface tapering is typical of present implementations of eddy transport in some current ocean models. The comparison is also promising versus available observations and results from an eddy-resolving model. These improvements include the elimination of strong, near-surface, eddy-induced circulations and a better heat transport profile in the upper ocean. The experiments with the new scheme also show reduced abyssal cooling and diminished trends in the potential temperature drifts. Furthermore, the need for any ad hoc, near-surface taper functions is eliminated. The impact of the new parameterization is mostly associated with the modified eddy-induced velocity treatment near the surface. The new parameterization acts in the depth range exposed to enhanced turbulent mixing at the ocean surface. This depth range includes the actively turbulent boundary layer and a transition layer underneath, composed of waters intermittently exposed to mixing. The mixed layer, that is, the regions of weak stratification at the ocean surface, is found to be a good proxy for the sum of the boundary layer depth and transition layer thickness.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Ferron, Bruno</author><author>Mercier, Herlé</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining Argo profiles with a general circulation model in the North Atlantic.

Here we present idealized experiments where the adjoint method is used to synthesize simulated sets of Argo profiles with a general circulation model, over a one-year period, in the North Atlantic. Using a number of drifting profilers consistent with Argo deployment objectives, the simulated array permits one to identify large-scale anomalies in the hydrography and circulation, despite the presence of a simulated eddy noise of large amplitude. Model dynamics provide an objective means to distinguish eddy noise from large-scale oceanic variability, and to infer the absolute velocity field (including abyssal velocities and sea surface height) from sets of Argo profiles of T and S. In particular, our idealized experiments suggest that volume and heat transports can be efficiently constrained by sets of Argo profiles. Increasing the number of Argo floats seems to be an adequate strategy to further reduce errors in circulation estimates.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Mercier, Herlé</author><author>Ferron, Bruno</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining Argo profiles with a general circulation model in the North Atlantic.

Fitting the real hydrographic observations leads to vast improvements in the model circulation, including the sea surface height and the meridional heat transport. We find striking differences in basin-scale transports compared with previous assimilation experiments that use the same GCM and a similar spatial resolution. Based on forward modeling studies, it is argued that these differences are due to different assimilation experiment durations. Over 1 year, the hydrography interpolated with the GCM from Argo profiles better represents the contemporary structures than does a long-term averaged climatology. The GCM dynamics are robust enough to distinguish between contemporary hydrography and climatological hydrography.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The MITgcm/ECCO adjoint modeling infrastructure</title><secondary-title>CLIVAR Exchanges 44</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CLIVAR Exchanges 44</full-title></periodical><pages>13-17</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><notes>Heimbach, P., 2008: The MITgcm/ECCO adjoint modeling infrastructure.

During runs covering the period 1992-2002, two different sets of surface forcing boundary conditions are used, obtained 1) from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis project and 2) from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) assimilation consortium. The &quot;ECCO forcing&quot; is the &quot;NCEP forcing&quot; adjusted by a state estimation procedure using the MITgcm with a 1 degrees x 1 degrees global grid and the adjoint method assimilating a multivariate global ocean dataset. The skill of the model is evaluated against ocean observations available in situ and from satellites. The model domain is limited to the tropical Pacific, with open boundaries located along 26 degrees S, 26 degrees N, and in the Indonesian throughflow. To account for large-scale changes of the ocean circulation, the model is nested in the global time-varying ocean state provided by the ECCO consortium on a 1 grid. Increasing the spatial resolution to 1/3 degrees and using the ECCO forcing fields significantly improves many aspects of the circulation but produces overly strong currents in the western model domain. Increasing the resolution to 1/6 degrees does not yield further improvements of model results. Using the ECCO heat and freshwater fluxes in place of NCEP products leads to improved time-mean model skill (i.e., reduced biases) over most of the model domain, underlining the important role of adjusted heat and freshwater fluxes for improving model representations of the tropical Pacific. Combinations of ECCO and NCEP wind forcing fields can improve certain aspects of the model solutions, but neither ECCO nor NCEP winds show clear overall superiority.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, S B</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A near uniform basin-wide sea level fluctuation over the Japan/East Sea: A semienclosed sea with multiple straits</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>113</volume><issue>C6</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric-pressure</keyword><keyword>barotropic flow</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>difference</keyword><keyword>geostrophic control</keyword><keyword>gibraltar</keyword><keyword>mediterranean sea</keyword><keyword>model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2007jc004409</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kim, S.

A significant fraction of the Japan/East Sea sea level variability is found to be spatially uniform with periods ranging from 20 d to a year. The model simulation is consistent with T/P records in terms of the basin-wide sea level fluctuation's spectral energy and coherence. The simulation indicates that the changes are barotropic in nature and controlled, notably at high frequencies, by the net mass transport through the straits of the Japan/East Sea driven by winds in the vicinity of the Korea/Tsushima and Soya Straits. A series of barotropic simulations suggest that the sea level fluctuations are the result of a dynamic balance at the straits among near-strait winds, friction, and geostrophic control. The basin-wide sea level response is a linear superposition of changes due to winds near the individual straits. In particular, a basin-wide sea level response can be established by winds near either one of the straits alone. For the specific geometry and winds, winds near the Soya Strait have a larger Strait.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of the meridional overturning in the North Atlantic from the 50-year GECCO state estimation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1913-1930</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric</keyword><keyword>boundary-layer parameterization</keyword><keyword>co2</keyword><keyword>decadal changes</keyword><keyword>global ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>heat-transport</keyword><keyword>labrador sea</keyword><keyword>mechanisms</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>overflow</keyword><keyword>thermohaline circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2008jpo3775.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kohl, A., and D.

The GECCO synthesis combines most of the data available during the entire estimation period with the ECCO-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) ocean circulation model using its adjoint. This GECCO estimate is analyzed here for the period 1962-2001 with respect to decadal and longer-term changes of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the North Atlantic. A special focus is on the maximum MOC values at 25 degrees N. Over this period, the dynamically self-consistent synthesis stays within the error bars of H. L. Bryden et al., but reveals a general increase of the MOC strength. The variability on decadal and longer time scales is decomposed into contributions from different processes. Changes in the model's MOC strength are strongly influenced by the southward communication of density anomalies along the western boundary originating from the subpolar North Atlantic, which are related to changes in the Denmark Strait overflow but are only marginally influenced by water mass formation in the Labrador Sea. The influence of density anomalies propagating along the southern edge of the subtropical gyre associated with baroclinically unstable Rossby waves is found to be equally important. Wind-driven processes such as local Ekman transport explain a smaller fraction of the variability on those long time scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decadal sea level changes in the 50-year GECCO ocean synthesis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>1876-1890</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>altimeter</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>heat-storage</keyword><keyword>measurements</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>rise</keyword><keyword>steric height</keyword><keyword>subsurface temperature</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword><keyword>world ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2007jcli2081.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kohl, A., and D.

The estimate results from a synthesis of most of the ocean datasets available during this 50-yr period with the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean/Massachusetts Institute of Technology (ECCO/MIT) ocean circulation model. Over the period 1992 through 2001, the increase in thermosteric sea level rise on average amounts to 1.2 mm yr(-1) over the top 750 m and 1.8 mm yr(-1) over the total water column. This corresponds to an increase in upper-ocean heat content of 1.5x10(22) J yr(-1) and is in agreement with the estimates of Willis et al. However, over the period 1962 through 2001 the global net thermosteric sea level rise is estimated as 0.66 mm yr-1 over the top 750 m, which is twice the recent estimate from Antonov et al. (0.33 mm yr(-1)). The corresponding trend over the total water column of 0.92 mm yr(-1) is also about twice their value for the layer of 0-3000 m (0.40 mm yr(-1)). For the last decade, the global heat flux into the ocean of 1.5 W m(-2) is twice as large as the recent estimate by Willis et al. due to the heat content change in deeper layers. Regional changes in sea level are predominantly associated with an intensification of the subtropical gyre circulation and a corresponding redistribution of heat. The horizontal advection of heat due to an increase in wind stress curl is found to explain a major fraction of the estimated regional sea level trends over the last 40 years. However, the mechanisms appear different during the last decade when in some regions changes in surface heat flux may explain as much as 50% of the sea level changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuo, C Y</author><author>Shum, C K</author><author>Guo, J Y</author><author>Yi, Y C</author><author>Braun, A</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Matsumoto, K</author><author>Sato, T</author><author>Shibuya, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Southern Ocean mass variation studies using GRACE and satellite altimetry</title><secondary-title>Earth Planets and Space</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth Planets and Space</full-title></periodical><pages>477-485</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>models</keyword><keyword>southern ocean</keyword><keyword>steric sea-level</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/BF03352814</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kuo, C.

The Southern Ocean sea level is poorly observed except from recent near-polar orbiting space geodetic satellites. In this study, the Southern Ocean mass variations at the seasonal scale are compared using three independent data sets: (1) the Gravity Recovery And Climate Recovery Experiment (GRACE) observed ocean bottom pressure (OBP), (2) steric-corrected satellite altimetry (ENVISAT) and, (3) the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model OBP data. The height difference between sea level derived from altimetry and steric sea level contains the vertical displacement of the Earth surface due to elastic loading. Here we provide a formulation of this loading term which has not been considered previously in other studies and demonstrate that it is not negligible, especially for regional studies. In this study, we first conduct a global comparison using steric-corrected JASON-1 altimetry with GRACE to validate our technique and to compare with recent studies. The global ocean mass variation comparison shows excellent agreement with high correlation (similar to 0.81) and with discrepancies at 3-5 mm RMS. However, the discrepancies in the Southern Ocean are much larger at 12-17 mm RMS. The mis-modeling of geocenter variations and the second degree zonal harmonic (J(2)) degrade the accuracy of GRACE-derived mass variations, and the choice of ocean temperature data sets and neglecting the loading correction on altimetry affect the OBP comparisons between GRACE and altimetry. This study indicates that the satellite observations (GRACE and ENVISAT) are capable of providing an improved constraint of oceanic mass variations in the Southern Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwok, R</author><author>Hunke, E C</author><author>Maslowski, W</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Zhang, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of sea ice simulations assessed with RGPS kinematics</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>113</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>0750 Sea ice</keyword><keyword>0758 Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>0762 Mass balance</keyword><keyword>0774 Dynamics</keyword><keyword>0798 Modeling</keyword><keyword>Sea ice simulations</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>satellite ice motion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC004783</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kwok, R., E.

In contrast to buoy drift, the density and extent of the RGPS coverage allows a more extensive assessment and understanding of model simulations at spatial scales from ∼10 km to near basin scales and from days to seasonal timescales. This work illustrates the strengths of the RGPS data set as a basis for examining model ice drift and its gradients. As it is not our intent to assess relative performance, we have selected four models with a range of attributes and grid resolution. Model fields are examined in terms of ice drift, export, deformation, deformation-related ice production, and spatial deformation patterns. Even though the models are capable of reproducing large-scale drift patterns, variability among model behavior is high. When compared to the RGPS kinematics, the characteristics shared by the models are (1) ice drift along coastal Alaska and Siberia is slower, (2) the skill in explaining the time series of regional divergence of the ice cover is poor, and (3) the deformation-related volume production is consistently lower. Attribution of some of these features to specific causes is beyond our current scope because of the complex interplay between model processes, parameters, and forcing. The present work suggests that high-resolution ice drift observations, like those from the RGPS, would be essential for future model developments, improvements, intercomparisons, and especially for evaluation of the small-scale behavior of models with finer grid spacing.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, M R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation as diagnosed from an eddy permitting state estimate</title></titles><periodical/><volume>Ph.D.</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>MIT-WHOI Joint Program</publisher><notes>Mazloff, M.

Despite this, these processes are not routinely represented in global ocean and climate models. It is shown that a new ice shelf cavity model for z coordinate models can reproduce results from an intercomparison project of earlier approaches with vertical σ or isopycnic coordinates. As a proof of concept, ice shelves are incorporated in a 100-year global integration of a z coordinate model. In this simulation, glacial meltwater can be traced as far as north as 15°S. The observed effects of processes in the ice shelf cavities agree with previous results from a σ coordinate model, notably the increase in sea ice thickness. However, melt rates are overestimated probably because the parameterization of basal melting does not suit the low resolution of this configuration.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Campin, J</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Nguyen, A</author><author>Schodlok, M</author><author>Zhang, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECCO2: High Resolution Global Ocean and Sea Ice Data Synthesis</title><secondary-title>Mercator Ocean Quarterly Newsletter</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mercator Ocean Quarterly Newsletter</full-title></periodical><pages>13-21</pages><volume>31</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><notes>Menemenlis, D., J.

We attempt a spatial mapping of these errors by comparing several GRACE data products to pb simulations from an ocean model. Uncertainties in the global ocean mean , partly related to the net freshwater flux into the ocean, and in the regional pb anomalies about that mean are considered separately. The resultant regional error estimates (∼1–3 cm), when zonally averaged, are comparable to the calibrated errors provided by the GRACE processing centers, except for enhanced errors near some continental regions with high seasonal hydrology signals or large mass trends. Errors in the GRACE-derived values estimated from model-data differences (∼0.2 cm) are also comparable with those from the calibrated errors. For both pb and estimates, accounting for the effects of geocenter noise is important. Replacing the C20 harmonic term in the GRACE data with estimates derived from satellite laser ranging results in significantly lower errors in the Southern Ocean. We also find lower errors at high latitudes when the variability of the atmospheric pressure over the land is removed from the data. Given the estimated errors and model-data comparisons, GRACE data should be useful for constraining estimates of , particularly at interannual periods, but less so when considering regional pb variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Park, S</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Lukas, R</author><author>Santiago-Mandujano, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Causes for large-scale hydrographic changes at the Hawaii Ocean time series station</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1931-1948</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>anomalies</keyword><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>decadal climate variability</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>rossby waves</keyword><keyword>subtropical gyre</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2008jpo3751.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., S.

The comparison shows that at this position, the estimated temporal variability has some skill in simulating observed ocean variability and that the quality of future syntheses could benefit from additional information available from the Argo network and from the time series observations themselves. On a decadal time scale, the influence radius of the station ALOHA T-S time series covers large parts of the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean and reaches even into the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Throughflow. Estimated changes in sea surface height (SSH) result largely from thermosteric changes; however, nonsteric (barotropic) variations on the order of 1-2 cm also contribute to SSH changes at station ALOHA. Moreover, changes of similar magnitude can be caused by changes in the salinity field because of a quasi-biennial oscillation in the horizontal flow structure and heaving of the mean salinity structure on seasonal and interannual time scales. The adjoint modeling framework confirms westward-propagating Rossby waves (due to wind forcing) and subduction of water-mass anomalies (due to surface buoyancy forcing) as the primary mechanisms leading to observed changes of T-S structures at station ALOHA. Specifically, the analysis identifies surface freshwater fluxes along the wintertime outcrop of intermediate waters as a primary cause for salinity changes at station ALOHA and wind stress forcing east of the station position as another forcing mechanism of salinity variations around the Hawaiian Archipelago.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schott, F A</author><author>Stramma, L</author><author>Wang, W</author><author>Giese, B S</author><author>Zantopp, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pacific Subtropical Cell variability in the SODA 2.0.2/3 assimilation</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>35</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008gl033757</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schott, F.

The state estimate combines most available observations, including all the altimetric missions, with a general circulation model in an optimization procedure. The annual cycle tends to be larger than the semi-annual one, except in tropical regions. For global mean ζ, annual thermosteric and freshwater terms are nearly out-of-phase and lead to an annual cycle of only a few mm in amplitude. Regionally, surface wind stress and heat flux are the primary drivers for seasonal ζ variations in the tropics and midlatitudes, respectively, with both mechanisms playing a role at high latitudes. A substantial part of the annual ζ variability can be assigned to changes in thermosteric height in the upper 100 m in midlatitudes and 200 m in the tropics. Bottom pressure variability is larger at high latitudes, and also in some regions in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific. Apparent nonlinear rectification processes lead to a noticeable impact of submonthly forcing on the annual cycle in the western North Atlantic and North Pacific. Other features include the substantial ζ gradients associated with strong spatial variability in seasonal surface heat flux in some western boundary regions, the damping effects of surface heat flux on the seasonal cycle in the tropics, and the importance of wind driving and bottom pressure in shallow regions, which can cause differences in the seasonal cycle in some coastal and contiguous deep-ocean regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of vorticity fluxes in the dynamics of the Zapiola Anticyclone</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>113</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4277 Time series experiments</keyword><keyword>4512 Currents</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>Vorticity fluxes</keyword><keyword>Zapiola Anticyclone</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC004841</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

A number of observations have discovered an intense anticyclonic gyre of barotropic circulation around the Zapiola Rise in the center of the basin. Theoretical studies have shown that the Zapiola Anticyclone represents an eddy-driven flow controlled by bottom friction. Recent advances in high-resolution global-ocean data syntheses, performed using NASA supercomputing facilities, provide realistic simulations of the circulation and the variability in the Argentine Basin. Using these simulations and satellite altimeter observations, we analyzed the vorticity balance of the Zapiola Anticyclone. Our results suggest the dominance of vorticity fluxes and the advection of the potential vorticity over a nonuniform bottom topography in determining the variability of the gyre, while the impact of the local wind stress is small. The divergence of the relative vorticity anomaly advection by eddies is found to be the most important contributor to the relative vorticity flux divergence influencing the variability of the Zapiola Anticyclone. Our results demonstrate that the relative vorticity influencing the variability of the anticyclone is mainly advected from the south where the northern branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current at the Subpolar Front is located.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eddy-induced meridional heat transport in the ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>35</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>eddy heat transport</keyword><keyword>oceanic heat transport</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008GL035490</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

The schemes are also compared based on remapping experiments in closed domains. The piecewise quartic method (PQM) is presented, based on fifth-order accurate piecewise polynomials, and is motivated by the need to significantly improve hybrid coordinate systems of ocean climate models, which require the remapping to be conservative, monotonic and highly accurate. A limiter for this scheme is fully described that never decreases the polynomial degree, except at the location of extrema. We assess the use of high-order explicit and implicit (i.e., compact) estimates for the edge values and slopes needed to build the piecewise polynomials in both piecewise parabolic method (PPM) and PQM. It is shown that all limited PQM schemes perform significantly better than limited PPM schemes and that PQM schemes are much more cost-effective.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mass and volume transport variability in an eddy-filled ocean</title><secondary-title>Nature Geosci</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Geosci</full-title></periodical><pages>165-168</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ngeo126</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2008: Mass and volume transport variability in an eddy-filled ocean.

To obtain some basic physical insight into their behavior, a global ocean circulation model, forced to least-square consistency with modern data, is used to find lower bounds for the time taken by surface-injected passive tracers to reach equilibrium. Depending upon the geographical scope of the injection, major gradients exist, laterally, between the abyssal North Atlantic and North Pacific, and vertically over much of the ocean, persisting for periods longer than 2000 years and with magnitudes bearing little or no relation to radiocarbon ages. The relative vigor of the North Atlantic convective process means that tracer events originating far from that location at the sea surface will tend to display abyssal signatures there first, possibly leading to misinterpretation of the event location. Ice volume (glacio-eustatic) corrections to deep-sea δ 18 O values, involving fresh water addition or subtraction, regionally at the sea surface, cannot be assumed to be close to instantaneous in the global ocean, and must be determined quantitatively by modelling the flow and by including numerous more complex dynamical interactions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, Nadya</author><author>Ponte, Rui</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relation between sea level and bottom pressure and the vertical dependence of oceanic variability</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>L03608</pages><volume>34</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/ 2006GL028588</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vinogradova, N., R.

Admittance and coherence analyses are used to characterize the bottom pressure and sea level relationship as a function of period, horizontal spatial scale, and location. At the model grid scale (1°), bottom pressure is found to be essentially equivalent to sea level at periods &lt;30 days, except in the tropics. This equivalence still holds for longer periods ( 100 days), but only at high latitudes (&gt;60°) and in shallow depths (&lt;200 m). Elsewhere, bottom pressure and sea level fields can differ significantly. Results indicate an increase of the importance of baroclinic signals with decreasing latitude and spatial scale, with significant baroclinic signals at intra-seasonal and longer periods present in many subtropical and mid-latitude regions. Variability is clearly baroclinic at inter-annual periods, regardless of location and spatial scale. Results have broad implications for the interpretation and processing of both satellite altimetry and gravity data and for their assimilation into numerical models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danabasoglu, Gokhan</author><author>Marshall, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of vertical variations of thickness diffusivity in an ocean general circulation model</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>122-141</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Mesoscale eddy parameterization</keyword><keyword>Ocean general circulation model</keyword><keyword>Vertically varying thickness diffusivity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2007.03.006</electronic-resource-num><notes>Danabasoglu, G., and J.

The model is the coarse resolution version of the ocean component of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3). Guided by the results of Ferreira et al. (2005) [Ferreira, D., Marshall, J., Heimbach, P., 2005. Estimating eddy stresses by fitting dynamics to observations using a residual-mean ocean circulation model and its adjoint. J. Phys. Oceanogr. 35, 1891–1910.] we employ a vertical dependence of the diffusivity which varies with the stratification, N2, and is thus large in the upper ocean and small in the abyss. We experiment with vertical variations of diffusivity which are as large as 4000 m2 s−1 within the surface diabatic layer, diminishing to 400 m2 s−1 or so by a depth of 2 km. The new solutions compare more favorably with the available observations than those of the control which uses a constant value of 800 m2 s−1 for both thickness and isopycnal diffusivities. These include an improved representation of the vertical structure and transport of the eddy-induced velocity in the upper-ocean North Pacific, a reduced warm bias in the upper ocean, including the equatorial Pacific, and improved southward heat transport in the low- to mid-latitude Southern Hemisphere. There is also a modest enhancement of abyssal stratification in the Southern Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenoglio-Marc, L</author><author>Kusche, J</author><author>Becker, M</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comment on &quot;On the steric and mass-induced contributions to the annual sea level variations in the Mediterranean Sea'' by David Garcia et al.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>112</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>time-variable gravity</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2007jc004196</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fenoglio-Marc, L., J.

Historical hydrography, recent data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, and Argo profile data are all used. Root-mean-square vertical displacements in the upper 300 m of the ocean are generally smaller than 50 m, except in energetic boundary currents and in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Variability in temperature and salinity is strongly correlated below the top 100 m. Salinity contributions to sea surface height variability appear more significant at low latitudes than expected, possibly resulting from advective and diffusive processes. Results are generally consistent with altimetric variability under two simple kinematic hypotheses, and much of the observed structure coincides with known dynamical features. A large fraction of the sea surface height variability is consistent with the hypothesis of dominance of the first baroclinic mode.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Lee, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A near-uniform basin-wide sea level fluctuation of the Mediterranean Sea</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>338-358</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>atmospheric-pressure</keyword><keyword>black-sea</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>flow-through</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>strait-of-gibraltar</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/Jpo3016.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., D.

More than 50% of the large-scale, nontidal, and non-pressure-driven variance of sea level can be attributed to this oscillation, which is nearly uniform in phase and amplitude across the entire basin. The oscillation has periods ranging from 10 days to several years and has a magnitude as large as 10 cm. The model suggests that the fluctuations are driven by winds at the Strait of Gibraltar and its neighboring region, including the Alboran Sea and a part of the Atlantic Ocean immediately to the west of the strait. Winds in this region force a net mass flux through the Strait of Gibraltar to which the Mediterranean Sea adjusts almost uniformly across its entire basin with depth-independent pressure perturbations. The wind-driven response can be explained in part by wind setup; a near-stationary balance is established between the along-strait wind in this forcing region and the sea level difference between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The amplitude of this basin-wide wind-driven sea level fluctuation is inversely proportional to the setup region's depth but is insensitive to its width including that of Gibraltar Strait. The wind-driven fluctuation is coherent with atmospheric pressure over the basin and contributes to the apparent deviation of the Mediterranean Sea from an inverse barometer response.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gebbie, Geoffrey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does eddy subduction matter in the northeast Atlantic Ocean?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>112</volume><issue>C6</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4528 Fronts and jets</keyword><keyword>mesoscale eddies</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword><keyword>subduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006JC003568</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gebbie, G., 2007: Does eddy subduction matter in the northeast Atlantic Ocean?

Observations from the Subduction Experiment of the northeast Atlantic do not have the spatial resolution necessary to calculate eddy subduction and answer this question. Regional numerical models can diagnose subduction, but their representativeness is unknown. Furthermore, water mass budgets in an open-ocean domain show that the simulated properties of subducted water directly depend upon uncertain open-boundary conditions and surface fluxes. To remedy these problems, a state estimate of the ocean circulation is formed by constraining an eddy-permitting general circulation model to observations by adjusting the model parameters within their uncertainty. The resulting estimate is self-consistent with the equations of motion and has the necessary resolution for diagnosing subduction. In the northeast Atlantic during 1991–1993, the time-variable circulation contributes less than 1 Sv of net subduction, while the total subduction is 4 Sv. Eddy volume fluxes of 40 m/yr in the North Equatorial Current and the Azores Current, however, are significant and rival the subduction by Ekman pumping locally. Furthermore, a state estimate at 1/6° resolution has 2–3 Sv more subduction in the density bands centered around σ = 24.0 kg/m3 and σ = 26.0 kg/m3 than a 2° state estimate. This result implies that the inability to accurately simulate mesoscale phenomena and surface fluxes in climate models would lead to an accumulation of errors in water mass properties over 10–20 years, even in the interior of the subtropical gyre.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean - The ECCO Consortia</title><secondary-title>U.S. CLIVAR Variations</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>U.S. CLIVAR Variations</full-title></periodical><pages>1-5</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><notes>Heimbach, P., and C.

At latitudes higher than 10 the zonal current correlation remains respectable, but OSCAR amplitudes diminish unrealistically. Variability of meridional currents is poorly reproduced, with severely diminished amplitudes and reduced correlations relative to those for zonal velocity on the equator. OSCAR's RMS differences from drifter velocities are very similar to those experienced by the ECCO ( Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) data- assimilating models, but OSCAR generally provides a larger ocean- correlated signal, which enhances its ratio of estimated signal over noise. Several opportunities exist for modest improvements in OSCAR fidelity even with presently available datasets.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, S B</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms controlling the interannual variation of mixed layer temperature averaged over the Nino-3 region</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3822-3843</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>1997-98 el-nino</keyword><keyword>atlantic-ocean</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>conceptual-model</keyword><keyword>equatorial pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>heat-budget</keyword><keyword>part i</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>tropical instability waves</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/Jcli4206.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kim, S.

The overall balance is such that surface heat flux opposes the MLT change but horizontal advection and subsurface processes assist the change. Advective tendencies are estimated here as the temperature fluxes through the domain's boundaries, with the boundary temperature referenced to the domain-averaged temperature to remove the dependence on temperature scale. This allows the authors to characterize external advective processes that warm or cool the water within the domain as a whole. The zonal advective tendency is caused primarily by large-scale advection of warm-pool water through the western boundary of the domain. The meridional advective tendency is contributed to mostly by Ekman current advecting large-scale temperature anomalies through the southern boundary of the domain. Unlike many previous studies, the subsurface processes that consist of vertical mixing and entrainment are explicitly evaluated. In particular, a rigorous method to estimate entrainment allows an exact budget closure. The vertical mixing across the mixed layer (ML) base has a contribution in phase with the MLT change. The entrainment tendency due to the temporal change in ML depth is negligible compared to other subsurface processes. The entrainment tendency by vertical advection across the ML base is dominated by large-scale changes in upwelling and the temperature of upwelling water. Tropical instability waves (TIWs) result in smaller-scale vertical advection that warms the domain during La Nina cooling events. However, such a warming tendency is overwhelmed by the cooling tendency associated with the large-scale upwelling by a factor of 2. In summary, all the balance terms are important in the MLT budget except the entrainment due to lateral induction and temporal variation in ML depth. All three advective tendencies are primarily caused by large-scale and low-frequency processes, and they assist the Nino-3 MLT change. When the advective tendencies are evaluated by spatially averaging the conventional local advection of temperature, the apparent effects of currents with spatial scales smaller than the domain (such as TIWs) become very important as they redistribute heat within the Nino-3 domain. As a result, for example, the averaged zonal advective tendency counteracts rather than assists the Nino-3 MLT change. However, such internal redistribution of heat does not represent external processes that control the domain-averaged MLT.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Köhl, A.</author><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Cornuelle, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual to Decadal Changes in the ECCO Global Synthesis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>313-337</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>florida current</keyword><keyword>fresh-water</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>heat-transport</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>steady-state</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO3014.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kohl, A., D.

The estimate exactly satisfies the model equations without artificial sources or sinks of momentum, heat, and freshwater. To bring the model into agreement with observations, its initial temperature and salinity conditions were permitted to change, as were the time-dependent surface fluxes of momentum, heat, and freshwater. The estimation of these &quot;control variables&quot; is largely consistent with accepted uncertainties in the hydrographic climatology and meteorological analyses. The estimated time-mean horizontal transports of volume, heat, and freshwater, which were largely underestimated in the previous 2 optimization performed by Stammer et al., have converged with time-independent estimates from box inversions over most parts of the World Ocean. Trends in the model's heat content are 7% larger than those reported by Levitus and correspond to a global net heat uptake of about 1.1 W m(-2) over the model domain. The associated model trend in sea surface height over the estimation period resembles the observations from Ocean Topography Experiment ( TOPEX)/Poseidon over most of the global ocean. Sea surface height changes in the model are primarily steric but show contributions from mass redistributions from the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean and the Southern Ocean to the subtropical Pacific Ocean gyres. Steric contributions are primarily temperature based but are partly compensated by salt variation. However, the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean reveal a clear contribution of salt to large-scale sea level variations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, J</author><author>Zhou, Y H</author><author>Liao, D C</author><author>Chen, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Excitation of annual polar motion by the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans</title><secondary-title>Chinese Journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>831-838</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>(OAMF)</keyword><keyword>annual polar motion</keyword><keyword>atmospheric angular momentum function (AAMF)</keyword><keyword>atmospheric angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>earth rotation</keyword><keyword>excitation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>oceanic angular momentum function</keyword><keyword>wobble</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1009-9271/7/6/11</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ma, J., Y.

The result shows that due to its particular location and shape, the Atlantic Ocean makes a less significant contribution to the x-component of the annual polar motion excitation than the Pacific and Indian Oceans, while all these three oceans contribute to the y-component of the annual polar motion excitation to some extent.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Losch, M</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adjoint sensitivity of an ocean general circulation model to bottom topography</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>377-393</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>annual-mean climatology</keyword><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>coarse-resolution</keyword><keyword>geopotential-coordinate models</keyword><keyword>heat-transport</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic circulation</keyword><keyword>overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>variational data assimilation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>Doi 10.1175/Jpo3017.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Losch, M., and P.

With the help of an adjoint model, it is shown that scalar diagnostics or objective functions in a coarse-resolution model, such as the transport through Drake Passage, the strength of the Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation, the Deacon cell, and the meridional heat transport across 32 S, are sensitive to bottom topography as much as they are to surface boundary conditions. For example, adjoint topography sensitivities of the transport through Drake Passage are large in choke-point areas such as the Crozet - Kerguelen Plateau and south of New Zealand; the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is sensitive to topography in the western boundary region of the North Atlantic Ocean and along the Scotland - Iceland Ridge. Many sensitivities are connected to steep topography and can be interpreted in terms of bottom form stress, that is, the product of bottom pressure and topography gradient. The adjoint sensitivities are found to agree with direct perturbation methods with deviations smaller than 30% for significant perturbations on time scales of 100 yr, so that the assumption of quasi linearity that is implicit in the adjoint method holds. The horizontal resolution of the numerical model affects the sensitivities to bottom topography, but large-scale patterns and the overall impact of changes in topography appear to be robust. The relative impact of changes in topography and surface boundary conditions on the model circulation is estimated by multiplying the adjoint sensitivities with assumed uncertainties. If the uncertainties are correlated in space, changing the surface boundary conditions has a larger impact on the scalar diagnostics than topography does, but the effects can locally be on the same order of magnitude if uncorrelated uncertainties are assumed. In either case, bottom topography variations within their prior uncertainties affect the solution of an ocean circulation model. To this extent, including topography in the control vector can be expected to compensate for identifiable model errors and, thus, to improve the solutions of estimation problems.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mikaloff Fletcher, S E</author><author>Gruber, N</author><author>Jacobson, A R</author><author>Gloor, M</author><author>Doney, S C</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Gerber, M</author><author>Follows, M</author><author>Joos, F</author><author>Lindsay, K</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Mouchet, A</author><author>Müller, S A</author><author>Sarmiento, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inverse estimates of the oceanic sources and sinks of natural CO2 and the implied oceanic carbon transport</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>21</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modelin</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>4845 Nutrients and nutrient cycling</keyword><keyword>air-sea CO2 exchange</keyword><keyword>natural carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>ocean inversion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006GB002751</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mikaloff Fletcher, S.

We employ a suite of 10 different Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs) to quantify the error arising from uncertainties in the modeled transport required to link the interior ocean observations to the surface fluxes. The results from the contributing OGCMs are weighted using a model skill score based on a comparison of each model's simulated natural radiocarbon with observations. We find a pattern of air-sea flux of natural CO2 characterized by outgassing in the Southern Ocean between 44°S and 59°S, vigorous uptake at midlatitudes of both hemispheres, and strong outgassing in the tropics. In the Northern Hemisphere and the tropics, the inverse estimates generally agree closely with the natural CO2 flux results from forward simulations of coupled OGCM-biogeochemistry models undertaken as part of the second phase of the Ocean Carbon Model Intercomparison Project (OCMIP-2). The OCMIP-2 simulations find far less air-sea exchange than the inversion south of 20°S, but more recent forward OGCM studies are in better agreement with the inverse estimates in the Southern Hemisphere. The strong source and sink pattern south of 20°S was not apparent in an earlier inversion study, because the choice of region boundaries led to a partial cancellation of the sources and sinks. We show that the inversely estimated flux pattern is clearly traceable to gradients in the observed ΔCgasex, and that it is relatively insensitive to the choice of OGCM or potential biases in ΔCgasex. Our inverse estimates imply a southward interhemispheric transport of 0.31 ± 0.02 Pg C yr−1, most of which occurs in the Atlantic. This is considerably smaller than the 1 Pg C yr−1 of Northern Hemisphere uptake that has been inferred from atmospheric CO2 observations during the 1980s and 1990s, which supports the hypothesis of a Northern Hemisphere terrestrial sink.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Lee, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atlantic to Mediterranean sea level difference driven by winds near Gibraltar strait</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>359-376</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>atmospheric-pressure</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>flows</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/Jpo3015.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Menemenlis, D., I.

Theoretical arguments and numerical experiments establish that this wind-driven sea level difference is caused in part by storm surges due to alongshore winds near the North African coastline on the Atlantic side of Gibraltar. The fraction of the Moroccan coastal current offshore of the 284-m isobath is deflected across Gibraltar Strait, west of Camarinal Sill, resulting in a geostrophic surface pressure gradient that contributes to a sea level difference at the stationary limit. The sea level difference is also caused in part by the along-strait wind setup, with a contribution proportional to the along- strait wind stress and to the length of Gibraltar Strait and adjoining regions and inversely proportional to its depth. In the 20 - 360-day band, average transfer coefficients between the Atlantic - Alboran sea level difference and surface wind stress at 36 degrees N, 6.5 degrees W, estimated from barometrically corrected Ocean Topography Experiment ( TOPEX)/Poseidon data and NCEP - NCAR reanalysis data, are 0.10 +/- 0.04 m Pa(-1) with 1 +/- 5-day lag and 0.19 +/- 0.08 m Pa(-1) with 5 +/- 4-day lag for the zonal and meridional wind stresses, respectively. This transfer function is consistent with equivalent estimates derived from a 1992 - 2003 high-resolution barotropic simulation forced by the NCEP - NCAR wind stress. The barotropic simulation explains 29% of the observed Atlantic - Alboran sea level difference in the 20 - 360-day band. In turn, the Alboran and Mediterranean mean sea level time series are highly correlated, rho = 0.7 in the observations and rho = 0.8 in the barotropic simulation, hence providing a pathway for winds near Gibraltar Strait to affect the mean sea level of the entire Mediterranean.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Vinogradov, Sergey V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of Stratification on the Large-Scale Ocean Response to Barometric Pressure</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>245-258</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Model evaluation/performance,General circulation m</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO3010.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

The potential effects of stratification on this response are explored here using a general circulation model in a near-global domain with realistic coasts and bathymetry. Periodic forcing by the diurnal and semidiurnal atmospheric tides and 6-hourly stochastic forcing from weather center analyses are both examined. A global dynamic response (i.e., departures from inverted barometer behavior) is clear in the response to atmospheric tides; for stochastic forcing, the largest dynamic signals occur in shallow and semienclosed regions and at mid- and high latitudes. The influence of stratification in the dynamics is assessed by comparing surface and bottom pressure signals. Baroclinic effects are generally weak, particularly in the response to the large-scale atmospheric tides. Under stochastic forcing, largest differences between surface and bottom pressure signals reach 10%–20% of the surface signals and tend to occur in regions of enhanced topographic gradients. Bottom-intensified, localized interactions with topography seem to be involved. Enhanced baroclinicity is also seen at low latitudes, where stratification effects are also felt in the upper ocean. General implications for modeling the ocean response to high-frequency atmospheric and tidal forcing are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Quinn, K J</author><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of model and GRACE estimates of the large-scale seasonal cycle in ocean bottom pressure</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>34</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>errors</keyword><keyword>mass</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>system</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2007gl029599</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

For the residual spatially-varying patterns, GRACE and model results agree well over the Southern Ocean where strongest variability at both annual and semiannual periods is present. Phase patterns tend to match well, although model amplitudes are generally weaker. Considerable uncertainty remains in both GRACE and model pb fields, judging from the spread among available estimates.

Comparisons between the independent Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon and Jason-1 altimetric missions when they were in identical orbits show that point by point the data are consistent within the mission specifications of about 3-cm rms, but large-scale dependences exist in the data differences, and these are both poorly known and capable of introducing major errors into oceanic state estimates. Here the authors focus on the time-variable component of the spatially dependent errors. The analysis reveals errors ranging from 2 cm in the Tropics to 4 cm at mid- and high latitudes and roughly consistent with a dependence of instrument noise on significant wave height. Analysis of the representation errors suggests that, over the deep ocean, uncertainties associated with the simplifying assumption of an inverted barometer response to pressure loading are larger than the remaining errors in modeling the large-scale tides. Over extensive regions, however, errors associated with eddy signals missing in coarse resolution models dominate. Obtaining a more quantitative estimate of the latter errors remains a challenge.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schott, F A</author><author>Wang, W Q</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of Pacific subtropical cells in the 50-year ECCO assimilation</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>34</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>simulation</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006gl028478</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schott, F.

The study is based on several circulation estimates obtained over the period 1992–2002 by combining most of the available ocean datasets with a global general circulation model on a 1° horizontal grid and by exchanging only the EGM96 geoid model with two different geoid models available from GRACE. As compared to the EGM96-based solution, the GRACE geoid leads to an estimate of the ocean circulation that is more consistent with the Levitus temperature and salinity climatology. While not a formal proof, this finding supports the inference of a substantially improved GRACE geoid skill. However, oceanographic implications of the GRACE model are only modest compared to what can be obtained from ocean observations alone. To understand the extent to which this is merely a consequence of a not-optimally converged solution or if a much more accurate geoid field could in principle play a profound role in the ocean estimation procedure, an additional experiment was performed in which the geoid error was artificially reduced relative to all other datasets. Adjustments occur then in all elements of the ocean circulation, including 10% changes in the meridional overturning circulation and the corresponding meridional heat transport in the Atlantic. For an optimal use of new geoid fields, improved error information is required. The error budget of existing time-mean dynamic topography estimates may now be dominated by residual errors in time-mean altimetric corrections. Both these and the model errors need to be better understood before improved geoid estimates can be fully exploited. As is commonly found, the Southern Ocean is of particular concern.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Suarez, Max</author><author>Trayanov, Atanas</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Schopf, Paul</author><author>Vikhliaev, Yuri</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>MAPL: a high-level programming paradigm to support more rapid and robust encoding of hierarchical trees of interacting high-performance components</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 2007 symposium on Component and framework technology in high-performance and scientific computing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 2007 symposium on Component and framework technology in high-performance and scientific computing</full-title></periodical><pages>11-20</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><pub-location>Montreal, Quebec, Canada</pub-location><publisher>ACM</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1145/1297385.1297388</electronic-resource-num><notes>Suarez, M., A.

The data include not only altimetric variability, but most of the modern hydrography, Argo float profiles, sea surface temperature, and other observations. Spatial-mean trends in altimetric data are explicitly suppressed to isolate global average long-term changes required by the in situ data alone. On large scales, some regions display strong signals although few individual points have statistically significant trends. In the regional patterns, thermal, salinity, and mass redistribution contributions are all important, showing that regional sea level change is tied directly to the general circulation. Contributions below about 900 m are significant, but not dominant, and are expected to grow with time as the abyssal ocean shifts. Estimates made here produce a global mean of about 1.6 mm yr−1, or about 60% of the pure altimetric estimate, of which about 70% is from the addition of freshwater. Interannual global variations may be dominated by the freshwater changes rather than by heating changes. The widely quoted altimetric global average values may well be correct, but the accuracies being inferred in the literature are not testable by existing in situ observations. Useful estimation of the global averages is extremely difficult given the realities of space–time sampling and model approximations. Systematic errors are likely to dominate most estimates of global average change: published values and error bars should be used very cautiously.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Practical global oceanic state estimation</title><secondary-title>Physica D-Nonlinear Phenomena</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physica D-Nonlinear Phenomena</full-title></periodical><pages>197-208</pages><volume>230</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>adjoint method</keyword><keyword>assimilation</keyword><keyword>atlantic circulation</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>construction</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>fitting dynamics</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>method of lagrange multipliers</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>sensitivity-analysis</keyword><keyword>state estimate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.physd.2006.09.040</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., and P.

In practice, all such methods reduce, on the computer, to forms of least-squares. The global oceanographic problem is at the present time focussed primarily on smoothing, rather than forecasting, and the data types are unlike meteorological ones. As formulated in the consortium Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), an automatic differentiation tool is used to calculate the so-called adjoint code of the GCM, and the method of Lagrange multipliers used to render the problem one of unconstrained least squares minimization. Major problems today lie less with the numerical algorithms (least-squares problems can be solved by many means) than with the issues of data and model error. Results of ongoing calculations covering the period of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, and including among other data, satellite altimetry from TOPEX/POSEIDON, Jason-1, ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, and GFO, a global array of profiling floats from the Argo program, and satellite gravity data from the GRACE mission, suggest that the solutions are now useful for scientific purposes. Both methodology and applications are developing in a number of different directions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The GRACE BP signals are compared with those derived from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean ( ECCO) ocean modeling - assimilation system, and to a non-Boussinesq version of the Regional Ocean Model System ( ROMS). The discrepancy found between GRACE and the models is 1.7 cm(H2O) ( 1 cm(H2O) similar to 1 hPa), slightly lower than the 1.9 cm(H2O) estimated by the authors independently from propagation of GRACE errors. The northern signals are weak and uncorrelated among basins. The southern signals are strong, with a common seasonality. The seasonal cycle GRACE data observed in the Pacific and Indian Ocean sectors of the ACC are consistent, with annual and semiannual amplitudes of 3.6 and 0.6 cm(H2O) ( 1.1 and 0.6 cm(H2O) with ECCO), the average over the full southern path peaks ( stronger ACC) in the southern winter, on days of year 197 and 97 for the annual and semiannual components, respectively; the Atlantic Ocean annual peak is 20 days earlier. An approximate conversion factor of 3.1 Sv ( Sv equivalent to 106 m(3) s(-1)) of barotropic transport variability per cm(H2O) of BP change is estimated. Wind stress data time series from the Quick Scatterometer ( QuikSCAT), averaged monthly, zonally, and over the latitude band 40 degrees - 65 degrees S, are also constructed and subsampled at the same months as with the GRACE data.

In this preliminary feasibility study, the model is run during 1993 with a simplified vertical mixing physics. It is constrained by monthly SST fields, monthly climatological θ, S fields and TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry. The adjoint model is built using automatic differentiation software. The method aims at bringing the model’s trajectory to consistency with data, by adjusting the initial θ, S fields, the time-varying atmospheric forcing fields and the time-varying open-boundary values. An originality of the work is the ‘nested approach’, which uses optimized fields from a global, coarser resolution model for the open-boundary conditions and for the prior estimates of the surface conditions adjustments. A solution is obtained after 75 iterations. This study shows that significant changes can be obtained on the open-boundary values, and that a general improvement in the circulation is achieved in the constrained solution, mainly in the Gulf Stream and equatorial regions. Changes at the open boundaries are characterized by a large temporal variability and small spatial scales. Large local adjustments are found close to the bottom and are likely unrealistic. There, the method tends to compensate for some model’s deficiencies by computing large corrections on the open-boundary values. The analysis of the cost function gradients with respect to the controls allows us to explore the local consistency between the constraints from the different data sets. This study suggests that no fundamental difficulty emerges when constraining open-boundary values. Its extension to a longer run with complete mixing physics can be envisaged.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bugnion, Véronique</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Stone, Peter H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Adjoint Analysis of the Meridional Overturning Circulation in an Ocean Model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3732-3750</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI3787.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Bugnion, V., C.

Steady-state sensitivities to diapycnal mixing, wind stress, freshwater, and heat forcing are examined. Three different, commonly used, boundary-forcing scenarios are studied, both with and without wind forcing. Almost identical circulation is achieved in each scenario, but the sensitivity patterns show major (quantitative and qualitative) differences. Sensitivities to surface forcing and diapycnal mixing are substantially larger under mixed boundary conditions, in which fluxes of freshwater and heat are supplemented by a temperature relaxation term or under flux boundary conditions, in which climatological fluxes alone drive the circulation, than under restoring boundary conditions. The sensitivity pattern to diapycnal mixing, which peaks in the Tropics is similar both with and without wind forcing. Wind does, however, increase the sensitivity to diapycnal mixing in the regions of Ekman upwelling and decreases it in the regions of Ekman downwelling. Wind stress in the Southern Oceans plays a crucial role in restoring boundary conditions, but the effect is largely absent under mixed or flux boundary conditions. The results highlight how critical a careful formulation of the surface forcing terms is to ensuring a proper response to changes in forcing in ocean models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Douglass, Elizabeth</author><author>Roemmich, Dean</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual variability in northeast Pacific circulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>C04001</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>C4</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4275 Remote sensing and electromagnetic processes</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>model-data comparison</keyword><keyword>northeast Pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005JC003015</electronic-resource-num><notes>Douglass, E., D.

XBT temperature profiles with high spatial resolution are available in the eastern North Pacific along two repeated transects. These ship tracks, along with the coast of North America, define a closed “box” which is used to study the time-mean circulation and its variability on interannual timescales. Geostrophic velocities from XBT data are compared with geostrophic velocities from model output as well as the full model velocity fields. Correlations in variability on interannual timescales between transport in the subpolar gyre and in the subtropical gyre are present in both model output and data. The nature of the variability, and its relation to the changes of the strength of the North Pacific Current (NPC), which supplies the water for both gyres, are explored. Interannual variability in gyre transport is found to be related to both the bifurcation of the NPC, resulting in an anticorrelation in transport between the two gyres, and to variations in NPC strength, resulting in simultaneous changes in the two gyres. The dominant signal is found to be a long-term increase in the NPC, which results in a strengthening of the subtropical gyre. Possible connections with local-scale wind stress changes and with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation phenomenon are also explored.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Follows, M J</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Controls on ocean productivity and air-sea carbon flux: An adjoint model sensitivity study</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric co2</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>export</keyword><keyword>fertilization</keyword><keyword>impact</keyword><keyword>iron</keyword><keyword>northeast</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>phosphorus</keyword><keyword>phytoplankton growth</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/gl024987</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dutkiewicz, S., M.

Modeled productivity and carbon flux are found to be most sensitive to enhanced iron sources in high nitrate low chlorophyll regions. The relative response of productivity to an enhanced iron source is greatest in the Equatorial Pacific. Although surface macro-nutrients are more abundant in the Southern Ocean, nutrient utilization here is critically regulated by light limitation. Our results differ from those of previous studies which imposed depletion of surface nutrients and ignore the availability of light.

In that framework, mean buoyancy is advected by the residual velocity (the sum of the Eulerian and eddy-induced velocities) and modified by a residual flux which accounts for the diabatic effects of mesoscale eddies. The residual velocity is obtained by stepping forward a residual-mean momentum equation in which eddy stresses appear as forcing terms. Study of the spatial distribution of eddy stresses, derived by using them as control parameters to “fit” the residual-mean model to observations, supports the idea that eddy stresses can be likened to a vertical down-gradient flux of momentum with a coefficient which is constant in the vertical. The residual eddy flux is set to zero in the ocean interior, where mesoscale eddies are assumed to be quasi-adiabatic, but is parameterized by a horizontal down-gradient diffusivity near the surface where eddies develop a diabatic component as they stir properties horizontally across steep isopycnals. The residual-mean model is implemented and tested in the MIT general circulation model. It is shown that the resulting model (1) has a climatology that is superior to that obtained using the Gent and McWilliams parameterization scheme with a spatially uniform diffusivity and (2) allows one to significantly reduce the (spurious) horizontal viscosity used in coarse-resolution GCMs.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathways of eddies in the South Atlantic Ocean revealed from satellite altimeter observations</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>33</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>4512 Currents</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4528 Fronts and jets</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006GL026245</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fu, L.-L., 2006: Pathways of eddies in the South Atlantic Ocean revealed from satellite altimeter observations.

The mathematical nature of the problem is examined and some of its common solutions are described, clarifying some of the implicit assumptions that underlie both problem and solution. For instance, Kalman filtering and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing can be identified as recursive least-squares inversions of the assimilation problem but of different parts of the problem. The temporal evolution of a filtered solution is not physically consistent, but that of a smoothed solution is. Understanding these characteristics is essential in effectively assimilating observations as well as in utilizing and further improving the assimilated solution.

Two major challenges exist for a state estimate that is nested inside a global state estimate: (1) estimation of open-boundary conditions consistent with information interior and exterior to the regional domain and (2) estimation with the higher-resolution models of regional studies. Here a least squares cost function defines the problem of minimizing the misfit between a North Atlantic regional general circulation model and actual observations, including those of the Subduction Experiment. A first experiment, using a novel “multiscale” method to constrain the large-scale regional circulation, shows that the use of the adjoint of both an eddy-permitting model and its coarse-resolution twin leads to a solution of the least squares problem in a computationally practical way. Therefore no fundamental obstacle exists to constraining the large-scale regional circulation nested within a global circulation. A second experiment in the North Atlantic shows that the model circulation can be constrained to the full observational signal, including eddy variability, as observed at selected point locations. Both experiments in this study produce eddy-permitting state estimates which are exactly self-consistent with the equations of motion as embodied by a general circulation model. Therefore dynamical balances can be diagnosed and easily interpreted; in particular, a companion paper uses the state estimates to determine eddy subduction rates in the North Atlantic.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Evangelinos, C</author><author>Forget, G</author><author>Mazloff, M</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Vinogradov, S</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining Altimetric and All Other Data with a General Circulation Model.</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 15 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry Symposium</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 15 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry Symposium</full-title></periodical><volume>SP-614</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>Venice, 13-18 March 2006</pub-location><publisher>ESA Special Publication SP-614</publisher><notes>Heimbach, P., R.

Conventional procedures to estimate entrainment heat advection often do not permit the closure of heat and temperature budgets because of inaccuracies in its formulation. In this study a rigorous approach to evaluate the effect of entrainment using the output of a general circulation model ( GCM) that does not have an explicit prognostic mixed layer model is described. The integral elements of the evaluation are 1) the rigorous estimates of the temperature difference between mixed layer water and entrained water at each horizontal grid point, 2) the formulation of the temperature difference such that the budget closes over a volume greater than one horizontal grid point, and 3) the apparent warming of the mixed layer during the mixed layer shoaling to account for the weak vertical temperature gradient within the mixed layer. This evaluation of entrainment heat advection is compared with the estimates by other commonly used ad hoc formulations by applying them in three regions: the north-central Pacific, the Kuroshio Extension, and the Nino-3 areas in the tropical Pacific. In all three areas the imbalance in the mixed layer temperature budget by the ad hoc estimates is significant, reaching a maximum of about 4 K yr(-1).</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krakauer, Nir Y</author><author>Randerson, James T</author><author>Primeau, FranÇOis W</author><author>Gruber, Nicolas</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carbon isotope evidence for the latitudinal distribution and wind speed dependence of the air–sea gas transfer velocity</title><secondary-title>Tellus B</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tellus B</full-title></periodical><pages>390-417</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1600-0889.2006.00223.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Krakauer, N.

Here, we use oceanic and atmospheric observations of 14C and 13C to constrain the global mean gas transfer velocity as well as the exponent of its wind speed dependence, utilizing the distinct signatures left by the air–sea exchange of 14CO2 and 13CO2. While the atmosphere and ocean inventories of 14CO2 and 13CO2 constrain the mean gas transfer velocity, the latitudinal pattern in the atmospheric and oceanic 14C and 13C distributions contain information about the wind speed dependence. We computed the uptake of bomb 14C by the ocean for different transfer velocity patterns using pulse response functions from an ocean general circulation model, and evaluated the match between the predicted bomb 14C concentrations and observationally based estimates for the 1970s–1990s. Using a wind speed climatology based on satellite measurements, we solved either for the best-fit global relationship between gas exchange and mean wind speed or for the mean gas transfer velocity over each of 11 ocean regions. We also compared the predicted consequences of different gas exchange relationships on the rate of change and interhemisphere gradient of 14C in atmospheric CO2 with tree-ring and atmospheric measurements. Our results suggest that globally, the dependence of the air–sea gas transfer velocity on wind speed is close to linear, with an exponent of 0.5 ± 0.4, and that the global mean gas transfer velocity at a Schmidt number of 660 is 20 ± 3 cm/hr, similar to the results of previous analyses. We find that the air–sea flux of 13C estimated from atmosphere and ocean observations also suggests a lower than quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwok, R</author><author>Cunningham, G F</author><author>Zwally, H J</author><author>Yi, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ICESat over Arctic sea ice: Interpretation of altimetric and reflectivity profiles</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>111</volume><issue>C6</issue><keywords><keyword>0750 Sea ice</keyword><keyword>0758 Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>0762 Mass balance</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>laser altimetry</keyword><keyword>sea ice thickness</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005JC003175</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kwok, R., G.

This analysis includes data from six surveys. At the large scale the response of the ice-covered ocean to atmospheric loading is near ideal (i.e., approximately −1 cm/hPa). After removal of the inverted barometer effects and best available geoid the elevation signal is still dominated by unresolved geoid residuals (∼0.4 m) that can be seen in the similarity of the remaining spatial patterns. Seasonal differences in elevations over multiyear ice are consistent with snow depth climatology; the broad differential spatial patterns are indicative of interannual differences in multiyear ice coverage associated with advection. Patterns in the derived surface roughness fields correspond to the seasonal and perennial ice zones seen in QuikSCAT data. At the small scale, near-coincident RADARSAT imagery provides a spatial context for understanding the signature of the observed elevations, waveforms, and reflectivity, in particular, those associated with thin ice, open water, multiyear ice, and ridges. The precision of the elevation estimates measured over relatively flat sea ice, identified in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, is ∼2 cm. The unambiguous identification of ridged areas in coupled ICESat/RADARSAT analysis could be used to enhance the utility of SAR imagery for examining ridge distributions. Over a 20 day period we monitored the evolution of the reflectivity of a newly opened lead. The steep increase in reflectivity due to snow coverage suggests that dips in ICESat reflectivity are likely areas of thin ice and could serve as a basis for selection of tie points for use as sea level reference. Identification of these tie points is crucial for accurate estimation of sea ice freeboard.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manoj, C</author><author>Kuvshinov, A</author><author>Maus, S</author><author>Luhr, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean circulation generated signals</title><secondary-title>Earth Planets Space</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth Planets Space</full-title></periodical><pages>429-437</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>geomagnetic field</keyword><keyword>ocean flow</keyword><keyword>satellite measurements</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>1343-8832</isbn><notes>Manoj, C., A.

An assessment of the ocean-generated magnetic fields and their detectability may be of importance for geomagnetism and oceanography. Motivated by the clear identification of ocean tidal signatures in the CHAMP magnetic field data we estimate the ocean magnetic signals of steady flow using a global 3-D EM numerical solution. The required velocity data are from the ECCO ocean circulation experiment and alternatively from the OCCAM model for higher resolution. We assume an Earth's conductivity model with a surface thin shell of variable conductance with a realistic ID mantle underneath. Simulations using both models predict an amplitude range of +/-2 nT at Swarm altitude (430 km). However at sea level, the higher resolution simulation predicts a higher strength of the magnetic field, as compared to the ECCO simulation. Besides the expected signatures of the global circulation patterns, we find significant seasonal variability of ocean magnetic signals in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans. Compared to seasonal variation, interannual variations produce weaker signals.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matsumoto, K</author><author>Sato, T</author><author>Fujimoto, H</author><author>Tamura, Y</author><author>Nishino, M</author><author>Hino, R</author><author>Higashi, T</author><author>Kanazawa, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean bottom pressure observation off Sanriku and comparison with ocean tide models, altimetry, and barotropic signals from ocean models</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>33</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006gl026706</electronic-resource-num><notes>Matsumoto, K., T.

The empirical estimates of non-tidal signal from TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) and JASON-1 deviate from barotropic signals observed by OBP recorders, which can be attributed to baroclinic component in the altimeter data. We also compared the non-tidal barotropic signal derived from the observation with those from ECCO model (wind-driven) and Kyushu University model (pressure-driven). The comparison indicates that the pressure-driven model increases explained variance and it is suggested to combine the wind-driven model and the pressure-driven model in order to describe non-tidal ocean mass variability in particular at period shorter than 30 days.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mikaloff Fletcher, S E</author><author>Gruber, N</author><author>Jacobson, A R</author><author>Doney, S C</author><author>Dutkiewicz, S</author><author>Gerber, M</author><author>Follows, M</author><author>Joos, F</author><author>Lindsay, K</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Mouchet, A</author><author>Müller, S A</author><author>Sarmiento, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inverse estimates of anthropogenic CO2 uptake, transport, and storage by the ocean</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>20</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>0428 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4508 Coriolis effects</keyword><keyword>4808 Chemical tracers</keyword><keyword>anthropogenic CO2</keyword><keyword>carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>inverse modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005GB002530</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mikaloff Fletcher, S.

In order to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimated fluxes owing to modeled transport and errors in the data, we employ 10 OGCMs and three scenarios representing biases in the data-based anthropogenic CO2 estimates. On the basis of the prescribed anthropogenic CO2 storage, we find a global uptake of 2.2 ± 0.25 Pg C yr−1, scaled to 1995. This error estimate represents the standard deviation of the models weighted by a CFC-based model skill score, which reduces the error range and emphasizes those models that have been shown to reproduce observed tracer concentrations most accurately. The greatest anthropogenic CO2 uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean and in the tropics. The flux estimates imply vigorous northward transport in the Southern Hemisphere, northward cross-equatorial transport, and equatorward transport at high northern latitudes. Compared with forward simulations, we find substantially more uptake in the Southern Ocean, less uptake in the Pacific Ocean, and less global uptake. The large-scale spatial pattern of the estimated flux is generally insensitive to possible biases in the data and the models employed. However, the global uptake scales approximately linearly with changes in the global anthropogenic CO2 inventory. Considerable uncertainties remain in some regions, particularly the Southern Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Naumann, U</author><author>Utke, J</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Ozyurt, D</author><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Fagan, M</author><author>Tallent, N</author><author>Strout, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adjoint Code by Source Transformation with OpenAD/F</title><secondary-title>ECCOMAS CFD 2006: Proceedings of the European Conference on Computational Fluid Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECCOMAS CFD 2006: Proceedings of the European Conference on Computational Fluid Dynamics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><notes>Naumann, U., and Coauthors, 2006: Adjoint Code by Source Transformation with OpenAD/F.

A similar problem exists with the representation of volume changes implied by surface heat fluxes. Under the assumption of an equilibrium response, such surface loads merely lead to spatially uniform sea level fluctuations, which carry no dynamical significance. A barotropic model forced by realistic freshwater fluxes is used to test the validity of the equilibrium assumption on seasonal to daily time scales. The simulated nonequilibrium signals have amplitudes much weaker than those of the forcing, with standard deviations well below 1 mm over most of the deep ocean. Larger values (up to ∼1 cm) can be found in shallow and semienclosed coastal areas, where the equilibrium assumption can lead to substantial errors even at monthly and longer time scales. Forcing by mean seasonal river runoff yields similar results, and heat flux effects lead to weaker nonequilibrium signals. In contrast, nonequilibrium signals driven by atmospheric pressure loading are at least an order of magnitude larger than those forced by freshwater fluxes. The exceptions occur for some shallow, coastal regions in the Tropics and at the longest time scales, in general, where forcing by freshwater flux is much stronger than by pressure.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, Detlef</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Ueyoshi, Kyozo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal Changes in Ocean Eddy Transports</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>543-550</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation models</keyword><keyword>energy</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO2858.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., C.

Making the approximation that the variability reflects primarily eddy motions, a time-mean, but spatially varying, eddy mixing coefficient is then estimated along with its changes over the last decade. With a record length more than 2 times that previously available, the time-mean variability kinetic energy K, is statistically more reliable and smoother in its spatial pattern. Minimum values of K-E are present in the subpolar North Pacific Ocean and in the eastern South Pacific (both less than 100 cm(2) s(-2)). in contrast to the North Pacific, the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean shows relatively enhanced K,. Eddy kinetic energy and eddy mixing appear to have declined during the last decade over large parts of the western Pacific Ocean, in some regions by as much as 50% of the time-mean value. Increased eddy variability can be found in the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream regions, as well as in the Agulhas region, east of Australia, and at several locations along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Somewhat enhanced eddy variability and eddy mixing are also apparent in the eastern tropical Pacific. A numerical simulation of the ocean circulation at 1 degrees spatial resolution over a 10-yr period suggests that variations in eddy mixing of this order of magnitude measurably affect the deep temperature field in the vicinity of permanent frontal structures on a time scale of less than 4 yr. The meridional overturning circulation also reacts on these time scales. If persistent over longer periods in the ocean, these effects would be important for climate simulations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Takiguchi, Hiroshi</author><author>Fukuda, Yoichi</author><author>Otsubo, Toshimichi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mass-redistribution-induced crustal deformation of global satellite laser ranging stations due to non-tidal ocean and land water circulation</title><secondary-title>Earth, Planets and Space</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth, Planets and Space</full-title></periodical><pages>E13-E16</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>Satellite laser ranging</keyword><keyword>Topex/Poseidon</keyword><keyword>continental water load</keyword><keyword>crustal deformation</keyword><keyword>non-tidal ocean load</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>1343-8832</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/BF03353365</electronic-resource-num><notes>Takiguchi, H., Y.

For the regions most severely affected, the peak-to-peak displacements due to the NTOL are found to be as large as 3 mm for the horizontal components and 10 mm for the vertical component. The peak-to-peak displacements due to the CWL reach 3 mm for the horizontal components and 15 mm for the vertical component. We apply the time series of NTOL and CWL to precise SLR analysis. The LAGEOS orbit analysis reveals that the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model makes the root mean square (RMS) of the range residual 0.2% smaller, and that the CWL makes it 0.8% smaller, compared with the case where loading displacement is neglected. On the other hand, with the NTOL derived from Topex/Poseidon altimetry data, the SLR orbit fit is not improved.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thompson, B</author><author>Gnanaseelan, C</author><author>Salvekar, P S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability in the Indian Ocean circulation and salinity and its impact on SST anomalies during dipole events</title><secondary-title>Journal of Marine Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Marine Research</full-title></periodical><pages>853-880</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>barrier layer</keyword><keyword>bay</keyword><keyword>bengal</keyword><keyword>currents</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>interannual variability</keyword><keyword>mode events</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1357/002224006779698350</electronic-resource-num><notes>Thompson, B., C.

The model sinuilations are compared with HadISST, SODA and ECCO data sets. During the positive dipole years, the climatological cyclonic circulation in the Bay of Bengal weakens or is replaced by an anticyclonic circulation. The interannual variability in the Wyrtki Jet and Bay of Bengal circulation has significant influence on fresh water transport between the equatorial Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal. The salinity anomalies in the equatorial Indian Ocean are significant during the positive dipole years. The salinity anomalies are positive in the southeastern equatorial Indian Ocean and negative in the central equatorial Indian Ocean. The advection of low salinity water from the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal is attributed to the salinity anomalies in the central equatorial Indian Ocean. The salinity variability in the equatorial Indian Ocean influences the Surface and subsurface temperatures by forming or eroding the barrier layer.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, X P</author><author>Heflin, M B</author><author>Ivins, E R</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal and interannual global surface mass variations from multisatellite geodetic data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>B09401</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>B9</issue><keywords><keyword>deformation</keyword><keyword>earth</keyword><keyword>field</keyword><keyword>geocenter variations</keyword><keyword>gps data</keyword><keyword>motion</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>system</keyword><keyword>time-variable gravity</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005jb004100</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wu, X.

The estimates are derived by inverting GPS displacement series measured at roughly 450 continuously tracking sites and ocean bottom pressure (OBP) estimates of a data assimilated ocean circulation model from 1993 to 2004. The inversion uses a hybrid estimator after singular value decomposition of the normalized measurement equations with reduced reliance on a priori spectral information. The results are then compared and combined with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE) gravity data to provide enhanced spectral and geographic coverage. High fidelity degree-1 surface mass variation coefficients are recovered, corresponding to equivalent geocenter motion with better than 0.5 mm annual amplitude precisions in all three components. A clear annual surface mass cycle occurs in both GPS/OBP- and GRACE-derived results. There is very good agreement among the low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients and in global geographic pattern but with significant regional differences in amplitudes. Annual variations of average mass over the global oceans, Antarctica, and Greenland are then derived. Total surface mass over both Antarctica and Greenland peak in their respective summers due to increased atmospheric mass. Large interannual variations have also been found involving several continents in the 11-year GPS/OBP solution. The patterns of variation suggest that the recent satellite laser ranging (SLR) observation of a reversal in trend of the Earth's oblateness may be largely an interannual surface mass cycle with considerable contribution from the northern continents.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Discrete Inverse and State Estimation Problems</title></titles><periodical/><pages>371</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>Cambridge</pub-location><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><isbn>9780511535949</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/CBO9780511535949</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2006: Discrete Inverse and State Estimation Problems.

The least squares fit is both stable and adequately close to the data to make the analysis worthwhile. Changes over the 12 yr are spatially and temporally complex. A weak statistically significant trend is found in net North Atlantic volume flux above about 1200 m, which drops slightly (−0.19 ± 0.05 Sv yr−1; 1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1) but with a corresponding strengthening of the outflow of North Atlantic Deep Water and inflow of abyssal waters. The slight associated trend in meridional heat flux is very small and not statistically significant. The month-to-month variability implies that single-section determinations of heat and volume flux are subject to serious aliasing errors.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhong, M</author><author>Yan, H M</author><author>Wu, X P</author><author>Duan, J B</author><author>Zhu, Y Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Non-tidal oceanic contribution to polar wobble estimated from two oceanic assimilation data sets</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>147-154</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Earth rotation</keyword><keyword>atmospheric angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>climate model</keyword><keyword>earths annual wobble</keyword><keyword>excitation</keyword><keyword>motion</keyword><keyword>oceanic angular momentum (OAM)</keyword><keyword>polar wobble</keyword><keyword>rotation</keyword><keyword>signals</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jog.2005.10.011</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhong, M., H.

One product comes from Scripps Institution of Oceanography (ECCO), and the other is the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) developed at University of Maryland. The results show that seasonal fluctuations in these two assimilated ocean angular momentum (OAM) time series agree better with each other along the Greenwich meridian than along the 90 degrees E meridian. Furthermore, annual OAM change for ECCO is much closer to non-atmospheric residual, than that for SODA. However, annual OAM change for SODA along the Greenwich meridian compares better than that for ECCO to non-atmospheric-hydrologic residual, in which annual and semi-annual signals of land hydrologic angular momentum (LHAM) of a climate model are considered. At the meantime, annual LHAM signals along the 90 degrees E meridian derived from the climate model and from the GRACE data are also compatible with each other. It is likely that ECCO overestimates the annual change along the 90 degrees E meridian according to the angular momentum conservation law in the Earth system. Consequently, the oceanic role in polar wobble should be further examined. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The simulated sea-level variabilities are interpreted in relation to the Tsushima Warm Current, the Polar Front, and the subpolar gyre. The simulated and assimilated estimates account for about 29% and 49% of the measured sea level variance, respectively, and the difference between the two is mostly attributed to mesoscale variability corrections. The formal error covariance and separate assimilation of the satellite altimeter data reveal the higher efficacy of the ERS data in detecting the mesoscale variability compared to the T/P data. The assimilation impact lasts for a few months, reflecting the long lifetime of the subpolar gyre and the mesoscale eddies.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Liu, Timothy W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of high-frequency wind sampling on simulated mixed layer depth and upper ocean temperature</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>110</volume><issue>C5</issue><keywords><keyword>high-frequency wind</keyword><keyword>mixed layer</keyword><keyword>sea surface temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004JC002746</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., and T.

The differences in mixed layer depth and sea surface temperature resulting from these experiments are examined, and the underlying physical processes are investigated. The 24 hourly subsampling not only reduces the high-frequency variability of the wind but also affects the annual mean wind because of aliasing. While the former effect largely impacts mid- to high-latitude oceans, the latter primarily affects tropical and coastal oceans. At mid- to high-latitude regions the subsampled wind results in a shallower mixed layer and higher sea surface temperature because of reduced vertical mixing associated with weaker high-frequency wind. In tropical and coastal regions, however, the change in upper ocean structure due to the wind subsampling is primarily caused by the difference in advection resulting from aliased annual mean wind, which varies with the subsampling time. The results of the study indicate a need for more frequent sampling of satellite wind measurement and have implications for data assimilation in terms of identifying the nature of model errors.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, R E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intermediate-depth circulation of the Indian and South Pacific Oceans measured by autonomous floats</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>683-707</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>alace</keyword><keyword>flow patterns</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword><keyword>total geostrophic circulation</keyword><keyword>tracers</keyword><keyword>trajectories</keyword><keyword>transports</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>velocity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo2702.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Davis, R.

Mean velocities, seasonal variability, and lateral eddy diffusivity from the resultant 2583 float-years of data are presented. Area averages, local function fits, and a novel application of objective mapping are used to estimate the mean circulation. Patterns of mean circulation resemble those at the surface in both basins. Well-developed subtropical gyres, twice as strong in the Indian Ocean as in the Pacific, feed western boundary currents. Tropical gyres are separated by eastward flow along the equator in both hemispheres of both basins, although the Indian subcontinent splits the north Indian tropical gyre. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and west wind drifts are prominent in both basins, generally tending slightly southward but deviating to the north behind the Del Cano, Kerguelen, and Campbell Plateaus and, of course, South America. Remarkably, the eastern boundaries of the southern subtropical gyres in all three basins apparently occur in the ocean interior, away from land. The Indian Ocean's subtropical gyre, and perhaps part of the South Atlantic's, reaches east to a retroflection just upstream of the Campbell Plateau south of New Zealand. Seasonal variability at 900 m is focused around the equator with weaker variability found near certain bathymetric features. There is a remarkable agreement between the observed seasonable variability and that predicted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)-Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) data-assimilating numerical model. Aside from seasonal effects, eddy variability is greatest along the equator, in tropical and subtropical western basins, and along the ACC. Integrals of velocity across regional passages (Tasman Sea, Mozambique Channel) provide useful reference for hydrographic analyses of transport. Across whole ocean basins, however, the uncertainty associated with the appropriate continuity relation for horizontal flow (e.g., geostrophy vs nondivergence) is comparable to the mean flow.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferreira, David</author><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating Eddy Stresses by Fitting Dynamics to Observations Using a Residual-Mean Ocean Circulation Model and Its Adjoint</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1891-1910</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO2785.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ferreira, D., J.

Adjoint techniques are used to compute the three-dimensional eddy stress field that minimizes the departure of the coarse-resolution model from climatological observations of temperature. The resulting 3D maps of eddy stress and residual-mean circulation yield a wealth of information about the role of eddies in large-scale ocean circulation. In eddy-rich regions such as the Southern Ocean, the Kuroshio, and the Gulf Stream, eddy stresses have an amplitude comparable to the wind stress, of order 0.2 N m?2, and carry momentum from the surface down to the bottom, where they are balanced by mountain form drag. From the optimized eddy stress, 3D maps of horizontal eddy diffusivity ? are inferred. The diffusivities have a well-defined large-scale structure whose prominent features are 1) large values of ? (up to 4000 m2 s?1) in the western boundary currents and on the equatorial flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and 2) a surface intensification of ?, suggestive of a dependence on the stratification N?2. It is shown that implementation of an eddy parameterization scheme in which the eddy diffusivity has an N?2 dependence significantly improves the climatology of the ocean model state relative to that obtained using a spatially uniform diffusivity.A global ocean circulation model is formulated in terms of the ?residual mean? and used to study eddy?mean flow interaction.

It is shown that implementation of an eddy parameterization scheme in which the eddy diffusivity has an N?2 dependence significantly improves the climatology of the ocean model state relative to that obtained using a spatially uniform diffusivity.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Glazman, Roman E</author><author>Golubev, Yury N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of the ocean-induced magnetic field predicted at sea surface and at satellite altitudes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>110</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>0619 Electromagnetic theory</keyword><keyword>0689 Wave propagation</keyword><keyword>1517 Magnetic anomalies: modeling and interpretati</keyword><keyword>1545 Spatial variations: all harmonics and anomali</keyword><keyword>4275 Remote sensing and electromagnetic processes</keyword><keyword>Earth's magnetic field</keyword><keyword>ocean induction</keyword><keyword>ocean remote sensing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005JC002926</electronic-resource-num><notes>Glazman, R.

Well-known difficulties of numerical solution of the governing equations are resolved by reducing the problem to an equation for the electric field potential, Φ, as opposed to a more conventional approach focused on the vertical jump, ψ, of the magnetic field potential across a combined ocean/marine-sediment-layer spherical shell. The present formulation permits using more realistic input data on ocean currents and ultimately yields much greater (by at least an order of magnitude) values of the magnetic field at sea surface than predicted in earlier studies. Such large values are comparable to, and in some cases exceed, magnetic field variations caused by lithospheric and ionospheric sources on monthly to interannual timescales. At the 400-km altitude (of CHAMP satellite), the field attains 6 nT. The model predictions show favorable comparisons with some in situ measurements as well as with Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite magnetometer data.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gross, R S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atmospheric and oceanic excitation of decadal-scale Earth orientation variations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>B09405</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>B9</issue><keywords><keyword>angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>core</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>ice</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword><keyword>representation</keyword><keyword>rotation</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004jb003565</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gross, R.

Not surprisingly, since decadal-scale variations in the length of day are caused mainly by interactions between the mantle and core, the effect of the atmosphere and oceans is found to be only about 14% of that observed. More surprisingly, it is found that the effect of atmospheric and oceanic processes on decadal-scale changes in polar motion is also only about 20% (x component) and 38% (y component) of that observed. Therefore redistribution of mass within the atmosphere and oceans does not appear to be the main cause of the Markowitz wobble. It is also found that on timescales between 10 days and 4 years the atmospheric and oceanic angular momentum series used here have very little skill in explaining Earth orientation variations before the mid to late 1970s. This is attributed to errors in both the Earth orientation observations prior to 1976 when measurements from the accurate space-geodetic techniques became available and to errors in the modeled atmospheric fields prior to 1979 when the satellite era of global weather observing systems began.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Giering, Ralf</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An efficient exact adjoint of the parallel MIT General Circulation Model, generated via automatic differentiation</title><secondary-title>Future Gener.

The method is applied to an ocean GCM, resulting in substantial improvements of the solution relative to observations when compared to prior estimates: overall model bias and drift are reduced and there is a 10%-30% increase in explained variance. Within the context of this optimization, the following new estimates for commonly used ocean GCM parameters are obtained. Background vertical diffusivity is (15.1 +/- 0.1) X 10(-6) m(2) s(-2). Background vertical viscosity is (18 +/- 3) x 10(-6) m(2) s(-2). The critical bulk Richardson number, which sets boundary layer depth, is Ri(c), = 0.354 +/- 0.004. The threshold gradient Richardson number for shear instability vertical mixing is Rio = 0.699 +/- 0.008. The estimated isopycnal diffusivity coefficient ranges from 550 to 1350 m(2) s(-2), with the largest values occurring at depth in regions of increased mesoscale eddy activity. Surprisingly, the estimated isopycnal diffusivity exhibits a 5%-35% decrease near the surface. Improved estimates of initial and boundary conditions are also obtained. The above estimates are the backbone of a quasi-operational, global-ocean circulation analysis system.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Adcrocft, A</author><author>Campin, J M</author><author>Cheng, B</author><author>Ciotti, B</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Henze, C</author><author>Köhl, A</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Taft, J</author><author>Zhang, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NASA supercomputer improves prospects for ocean climate research</title><secondary-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</full-title></periodical><pages>89-96</pages><volume>86</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005EO090002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Menemenlis, D., and Coauthors, 2005: NASA supercomputer improves prospects for ocean climate research.

Here an attempt to estimate geographically varying fields of horizontal and vertical viscosity and diffusivity within a 9-yr-long estimation procedure is presented. The estimated coefficients are highly efficient in preserving watermass characteristics and frontal structures by reducing the model temperature and salinity drift, especially around the Southern Ocean. The estimated mean circulation results in stronger transports of western boundary currents and of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Moreover, an increase of about 10% in the strength of the meridional overturning circulation and in the poleward heat transport can be found. Estimated changes in the horizontal mixing coefficients seem to agree with the notion that diapycnal mixing is superfically high with Laplacian mixing formulations, especially close to frontal structures in the ocean. In comparison with adjustments in tracer diffusivities (vertically and horizontally), adjustments of viscosity coefficients are fairly minor outside lateral boundary regions, suggesting that state estimation attempts might be most successful in providing enhanced insight into tracer mixing.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thermohaline loops, Stommel box models, and the Sandstrom theorem</title><secondary-title>Tellus Series a-Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tellus Series a-Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>84-99</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>boundary-condition</keyword><keyword>chaos</keyword><keyword>equilibria</keyword><keyword>flow</keyword><keyword>global ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>instability</keyword><keyword>stability</keyword><keyword>thermal-convection</keyword><keyword>thermosyphon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1600-0870.2005.00093.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2005: Thermohaline loops, Stommel box models, and the Sandstrom theorem.

Stress dominates real oceanic flows, and its introduction into the purely thermally driven loop generates oscillations, multiple states, and instabilities at low diffusivity. When, within the Boussinesq approximation, salinity forcing and mixed boundary conditions are further introduced, an intricate pattern of response appears, dependent upon at least five non-dimensional parameters, including the time of onset of salinity forcing. The ability, in a one-dimensional loop, to produce such a rich array of dynamical behaviors, dependent in detail upon the problem parameters, suggests that in the absence of any general results relating one- to three-dimensional fluid flows, identification of the time-dependent behavior of a GCM with that of the one-dimensional loop Stommel models should be regarded as still primarily speculation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Total Meridional Heat Flux and Its Oceanic and Atmospheric Partition</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>4374-4380</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI3539.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2005: The Total Meridional Heat Flux and Its Oceanic and Atmospheric Partition.

Reversing the conventional approach of computing the ocean as an atmospheric model residual is done to permit calculation of a preliminary uncertainty estimate for the atmospheric flux. The structure of the ERBE errors is itself an important uncertainty. Total energy transport is almost indistinguishable from a hemispherically antisymmetric analytic function, despite the great asymmetry of the oceanic heat fluxes. ERBE data appear sufficiently noisy so that a considerable range of atmospheric transports remains possible: the maximum atmospheric value lies between 3 and 5 PW in the Northern Hemisphere, at one standard deviation, although the values are sensitive to the noise assumptions made here. The Northern Hemisphere ocean and atmosphere carry comparable poleward heat fluxes to about 28°N where the oceanic flux drops rapidly, but does not actually vanish until the oceanic surface area goes to zero. Within the estimated error bars, there is a remarkable antisymmetry about the equator of the combined ocean and atmospheric transports, despite the marked oceanic transport asymmetry.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Y H</author><author>Chen, J L</author><author>Liao, X H</author><author>Wilson, C R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic excitations on polar motion: a cross comparison among models</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><pages>390-398</pages><volume>162</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>atmosphere</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>earths wobble</keyword><keyword>equations</keyword><keyword>excitation</keyword><keyword>momentum (OAM)</keyword><keyword>ocean general circulation model (OGCM)</keyword><keyword>oceanic angular</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>rotation</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>signals</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-246X.2005.02694.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhou, Y.

In this paper, we analyse and compare observed non-atmospheric polar motion excitations with oceanic angular momentum (OAM) variations determined from four OGCMs, which include the parallel ocean climate model (POCM), a barotropic ocean model (BOM), the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) non-data-assimilating model (ECCO-NDA) and the ECCO data-assimilating model (ECCO-DA). The data to be analysed span a 5-yr overlapped period from 1993 to 1997. At annual timescale, considerable discrepancies exist between POCM and the other three models, which result mainly from differences in annual components of the forcing wind fields. At semi-annual timescale, however, POCM shows better phase agreement with observed non-atmospheric polar motion excitation than the other three ocean models. At intraseasonal timescales, ECCO-DA yields better agreement with observations, and reduces the variance of non-atmospheric excitations by similar to 60 per cent, 10-20 per cent more than those explained by the other three models. However, at the very short periods of 4-20 days, the BOM estimates could explain about half of the observed variance, twice as much as that by ECCO-NDA, and also shows considerably better correlation with observations. Due to different modelling schemes and methods, significant discrepancies could arise with respect to the quality of modelling large-scale oceanic mass redistribution and current variation. A complete understanding of global oceanic contributions to polar motion excitation still remains a challenge.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, J.‐L.</author><author>Wilson, C.

We examine oceanic contribution to polar motion using estimates from a data?assimilating ocean general circulation model and satellite radar altimeter observations. The data include model estimates of variations in oceanic mass (OBP) and meridional and zonal velocities. Sea level anomalies from TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) satellite altimeter measurements and steric sea surface height changes deduced from the model are also used to estimate OBP effects. Estimated oceanic contributions from both the model and T/P show considerably better agreement with polar motion observations compared with results from previous studies. The improvement is particularly significant at intraseasonal timescales. Both OBP and ocean current variations provide important contributions to polar motion. At intraseasonal timescales the oceans appear to be a dominant contributor to residual polar motion not accounted for by the atmosphere. The oceans also play an important role in seasonal excitation. Combined OBP and ocean current contributions explain much of the residual semiannual variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adcroft, A</author><author>Campin, J M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rescaled height coordinates for accurate representation of free-surface flows in ocean circulation models</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>269-284</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>cells</keyword><keyword>coordinate transformation</keyword><keyword>free</keyword><keyword>internal wave generation</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>numerical weather prediction</keyword><keyword>ocean model</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>schemes</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword><keyword>vertical coordinate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2003.09.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Adcroft, A., and J.

We present a resealed height coordinate, which we call z*, that treats the time-dependent free surface as a coordinate surface. This coordinate is isomorphic with the atmospheric eta coordinate, sometimes known as the step-mountain coordinate. The z* coordinate has also been used in a coastal ocean model. However, unlike both these implementations, here we use the finite volume method within the z* coordinate framework, allowing an accurate representation of topography. The resulting scheme provides a very accurate representation of motions over steep topography in a three-dimensional general circulation model, even with fast and large amplitude free-surface variations.

The finite-volume method naturally describes arbitrary grids, and use of the vector-invariant form of the momentum equations simplifies the generalization to arbitrary coordinates. Grids based on the expanded spherical cube of Rancic et al., which contain eight singular points, are used. At these singularities the grid is nonorthogonal. The combined use of vector-invariant equations and the finite-volume method is shown to avoid degeneracy at these singular points. The model is tested using experiments proposed by Williamson et al. and Held and Saurez. The atmospheric solutions are examined seeking evidence of the underlying grid in solutions and eddy statistics. A global ocean simulation is also conducted using the same code. The solutions prove to be accurate and free of artifacts arising from the cubic grid.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campin, J M</author><author>Adcroft, A</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conservation of properties in a free-surface model</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>221-244</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation models</keyword><keyword>free-surface</keyword><keyword>general</keyword><keyword>semtner ocean model</keyword><keyword>shallow water equations</keyword><keyword>tracer conservation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s1463-5003(03)00009-x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Campin, J.

However, NLFS does not guarantee exact conservation unless special care is taken in the implementation, and in particular the time stepping scheme, as pointed out by Griffies et al. (Monthly Weather Rev. 129 (2001) 1081). This paper presents a general method to implement a NLFS in a conservative way, using an implicit free surface formulation. Details are provided for two tracer time stepping schemes, both second order in time and space: a two time-level scheme, such as Lax-Wendroff scheme, guarantees exact tracer conservation; a three time-level scheme such as the Adams-Bashforth II requires further adaptations to achieve exact local conservation and accurate global conservation preventing long term drift of the model tracer content. No compromise is required between local and global conservation since the method accurately conserves any tracer. In addition to the commonly used backward time stepping, the implicit free surface formulation also offers the option of a Crank-Nickelson time stepping which conserves the energy. The methods are tested in idealized experiments designed to emphasize problems of tracer and energy conservation. The tests show the ability of the NLFS method to conserve tracers, in contrast to the linear free-surface formulation. At test of energy conservation reveals that free-surface backward time-stepping strongly damps the solution. In contrast, Crank-Nickelson time stepping exactly conserves energy in the pure linear case and confirms the NLFS improvement relative to the linear free-surface when momentum advection is included.

The skill of the 12-month lead SST forecast in the equatorial Pacific is comparable in both approaches. The optimization appears to have better skill in the SST anomaly correlations, suggesting that the initial ocean conditions and forcing corrections calculated by the ocean-state estimation do have a positive impact on the predictive skill.

Simulated passive tracers and their adjoint are employed to explicitly follow the circulation of specific water masses accounting for advective and diffusive effects and their time variabilities. The evolution of the forward passive tracer and adjoint passive tracer can be identified as describing where the tracer-tagged water mass goes and from where it comes, respectively. Over 10 years on average, water mass of the Nino-3 region can be traced back to eastern subtropical thermocline waters of the Northern (27%) and Southern Hemispheres (39%). The Nino-3 water subsequently returns to these subtropical latitudes in the upper ocean. In contrast to the hypothesized &quot;subtropical cell,'' however, this circulation is an open circuit with water returning to the western regions of the two hemispheres ( subtropical gyres) and to the Indian Ocean, instead of returning to its origins. The representative transit time scale from the subtropics to the Tropics is 10 15 yr. Temporal variability causes the tropical circulation inferred from a time-mean state to differ significantly from the average circulation. In particular, stirring due to nonseasonal, intra-annual variability significantly enhances the transport magnitude of the so-called interior pathways relative to that of the circuitous low-latitude western boundary pathways. Such short-circuit in the subtropical - tropical exchange may help better to explain tracer distributions, such as the observed midbasin tritium maximum in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Significant differences in circulation pathways are also identified that are associated with El Nino and La Nina events. The strength of the subtropical - tropical water mass exchange is estimated to have weakened during the 1990s.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gross, R S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Gegout, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atmospheric and oceanic excitation of length-of-day variations during 1980-2000</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>B01406</pages><volume>109</volume><issue>B1</issue><keywords><keyword>axial angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>bottom pressure</keyword><keyword>boussinesq approximation</keyword><keyword>earth rotation</keyword><keyword>earths rotation</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>length-of-day</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>oceanic angular momentum</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>seasonal budget</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003jb002432</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gross, R.

Here the relative contribution of upper atmospheric winds, surface pressure, oceanic currents, and ocean-bottom pressure to changing the length-of-day during 1980 - 2000 is evaluated using estimates of atmospheric angular momentum from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/ National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis project, estimates of the angular momentum of the zonal winds in the upper atmosphere from the United Kingdom Meteorological Office, and estimates of oceanic angular momentum from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean consortium's simulation of the general circulation of the oceans. On intraseasonal timescales, atmospheric surface pressure, oceanic currents, and ocean-bottom pressure are found to be about equally important in causing the length-of-day to change, while upper atmospheric winds are found to be less important than these mechanisms. On seasonal timescales, the upper atmospheric winds are more important than the sum of currents and bottom pressure in causing the length-of-day to change and, except at the annual frequency, are even more important than surface pressure changes. On interannual timescales, oceanic currents and ocean-bottom pressure are found to be only marginally effective in causing the length-of-day to change.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hill, C</author><author>Bugnion, V</author><author>Follows, M</author><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating carbon sequestration efficiency in an ocean circulation model by adjoint sensitivity analysis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>109</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>atmospheric co2</keyword><keyword>carbon sequestration</keyword><keyword>dioxide</keyword><keyword>heat-transport</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2002jc001598</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hill, C., V.

In contrast to perturbation sensitivity experiments, the adjoint approach provides a computationally efficient way to characterize both temporal and spatial variations of sequestration efficiency and residence time for a complete global model domain. Sequestration efficiency ( the percentage of carbon injected at a continuous point source that remains in the ocean after an elapsed time), for injections at the base of the main thermocline ( similar to 900 m), is initially lowest in the North Atlantic basin ( except for regions of deep convection in the Labrador Sea) relative to the North Pacific. For injection periods of the order of a century or more, however, the model suggests that Pacific injection sites are generally less efficient for a constant rate injection source. The mean residence time ( defined as the average period that impulsively injected carbon from a particular point source remains within the ocean) is also evaluated and mapped. This measure also suggests that Atlantic sequestration is more efficient in the long term. Our calculations draw out the dual role of convective mixing, both exposing shallow sequestration sources to the atmosphere and also, in the subpolar Atlantic and Labrador Sea, feeding carbon from shallow injection sources into the deep circulation away from the atmosphere.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ito, T</author><author>Marshall, J</author><author>Follows, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What controls the uptake of transient tracers in the Southern Ocean?</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>air</keyword><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>anthropogenic co2</keyword><keyword>carbon-dioxide</keyword><keyword>circulation models</keyword><keyword>gas-exchange</keyword><keyword>residual mean theory</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>transient tracers</keyword><keyword>transport</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003gb002103</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ito, T., J.

The streamline-averaged numerical model, which represents transport in the meridional plane, captures the observed distributions of CFC-11, bomb-Delta(14)C, and anthropogenic CO2. The model reproduces the observed relationship between CFC-11 and bomb-Delta(14)C and suggests that the upper branch of the residual overturning flow in the Southern Ocean is about 14 Sv, supporting previous inferences based on the observed buoyancy distribution and air-sea buoyancy fluxes. Scale analysis suggests that the limit of fast air-sea gas exchange is applicable to CFC-11, for which the surface concentration is close to equilibrium and cumulative ocean uptake is largely determined by physical transport processes. In the slow gas exchange limit, applicable to bomb-Delta(14)C, the surface concentration is far from equilibrium and the cumulative uptake is most sensitive to the parameterization of the gas transfer coefficient. Anthropogenic CO2 falls between those two limit cases and is sensitive to both transport processes and the gas transfer coefficient. Sensitivity studies using the streamline-averaged model suggest that uncertainties in air-sea buoyancy fluxes in current climatologies result in significant uncertainty in estimates of Southern Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 based on circulation and biogeochemistry models driven by, or brought into consistency with, the climatological fluxes. This uncertainty is sufficient to explain a significant amount of the spread in a recent model comparison study.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, S B</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 1997-1999 abrupt change of the upper ocean temperature in the north central Pacific</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>31</volume><issue>22</issue><keywords><keyword>america</keyword><keyword>anomalies</keyword><keyword>decadal climate variability</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>ecosystems</keyword><keyword>flux</keyword><keyword>heat-budget</keyword><keyword>model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004gl021142</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kim, S.

A solution to the design problem is presented here in terms of optimal observations that emerge as singular vectors of the modified data resolution matrix. The actual computation is feasible only for scalar quantities and in the limit of large observational errors. Identical twin experiments performed in the framework of a 18 North Atlantic primitive equation model demonstrate that such optimal observations, when applied to determining the heat transport across the Greenland - Scotland ridge, perform significantly better than traditional section data. On seasonal to interannual time scales, optimal observations are located primarily along the continental shelf and information about heat transport, wind stress, and stratification is being communicated through boundary waves and advective processes. On time scales of about 1 month, sea surface height observations appear to be more efficient in reconstructing the cross-ridge heat transport than hydrographic observations. Optimal observations also provide a tool for understanding changes of ocean state associated with anomalies of integral quantities such as meridional heat transport.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decadal weakening of the shallow overturning circulation in the South Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>31</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>arabian sea</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>transports</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>world ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004gl020884</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., 2004: Decadal weakening of the shallow overturning circulation in the South Indian Ocean.

Such a change has important implications to upper-ocean heat content and decadal climate variability of the Indian Ocean, as well as to the ecosystem and air-sea exchange of CO2 in the region.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Tang, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temperature advection: Internal versus external processes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1936-1944</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>1997-98 el-nino</keyword><keyword>equatorial pacific</keyword><keyword>heat-budget</keyword><keyword>mechanisms</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(2004)034&lt;1936:Taivep&gt;2.0.Co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., I.

This product is often integrated spatially to infer temperature advection over a region. However, the contribution along an individual direction can be dominated by internal processes that redistribute heat within the domain but do not control the heat content of the domain. A new formulation of temperature advection is introduced to elucidate external heat source and sink that control the spatially averaged temperature. It is expressed as the advection of interfacial temperature relative to the spatially averaged temperature of the domain by inflow normal to the interface. It gives a total advection of temperature that is identical to the spatial integration of local temperature advection, yet the contributions along individual directions depict external processes. The differences between the two formulations are illustrated by analyzing zonal advection of near-surface temperature in the eastern equatorial Pacific during the 1997-98 El Nino and the subsequent La Nina by an ocean general circulation model. The new formulation highlights the advection of warmer water at the western side of the Nino-3 region into (out of) the region to create part of the warming (cooling) tendency during El Nino (La Nina). In contrast, the traditional formulation is dominated by the effect of tropical instability waves within the region that redistribute heat internally. The difference between the two formulations suggests a need for caution in discerning mechanisms controlling heat content of a region. Spatial integration of local temperature advection does not explain external processes that control a domain's heat content. The conclusion applies not only to the advection of oceanic temperature, but also to that of any property in any medium.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, X W</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An adjoint sensitivity study of chlorofluorocarbons in the North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>109</volume><issue>C1</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint sensitivity</keyword><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>chlorofluoromethanes</keyword><keyword>construction</keyword><keyword>deep equatorial</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>global ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>transient tracers</keyword><keyword>ventilation</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003jc002014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Li, X.

These sensitivities are compared with those of spiciness, T - (beta/alpha) S, where alpha, beta are the thermal and haline expansion coefficients, respectively. High-sensitivity fields are candidates for providing the most powerful constraints in the corresponding inverse problems. In the dual (adjoint) solutions all three variables exhibit the major ventilation pathways and define the associated timescales in the model. Overall, however, spiciness shows the highest sensitivity to the flow field. In the North Atlantic Deep Water, sensitivities of CFC properties and spiciness to the isopycnal mixing and thickness diffusion are of the same order of magnitude. In the lower subtropical thermocline, sensitivities of CFC properties to the isopycnal mixing and thickness diffusion are higher. The utility of this sensitivity is undermined by the need to reconstruct their boundary conditions. Given the influence of T, S measurements on the density field, they produce the most powerful constraints on the model on the large scale. It still remains possible, however, that transient tracers can provide a larger relative information content concerning the mixing process between the near-surface boundary layer and the thermocline but dependent upon the ability to reconstruct accurate initial and boundary conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Losch, M</author><author>Adcroft, A</author><author>Campin, J M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How sensitive are coarse general circulation models to fundamental approximations in the equations of motion?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>306-319</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>accurate</keyword><keyword>boussinesq approximation</keyword><keyword>conservation</keyword><keyword>fluid</keyword><keyword>free-surface</keyword><keyword>ocean models</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>representation</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(2004)034&lt;0306:hsacgc&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Losch, M., A.

Such a data source will prove valuable in state estimation and constraining general circulation models (GCMs) in general. However, conventional GCMs make the Boussinesq approximations, a consequence of which is that mass is not conserved. By use of the height-pressure coordinate isomorphism implemented in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITGCM), the impact of non-Boussinesq effects can be evaluated. Although implementing a non-Boussinesq model in pressure coordinates is relatively straightforward, making a direct comparison between height and pressure coordinate (i.e., Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq) models is not simple. However, a careful comparison of the height coordinate and the pressure coordinate solutions ensures that only non-Boussinesq effects can be responsible for the observed differences. As a yardstick, these differences are also compared with those between the Boussinesq hydrostatic and models in which the hydrostatic approximation has been relaxed, another approximation commonly made in GCMs. Model errors (differences) caused by the Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations are demonstrated to be of comparable magnitude. Differences induced by small changes in subgrid-scale parameterizations are at least as large. Therefore, non-Boussinesq and nonhydrostatic effects are most likely negligible with respect to other model uncertainties. However, because there is no additional cost incurred in using a pressure coordinate model, it is argued that non-Boussinesq modeling is preferable simply for tidiness. It is also concluded that even coarse-resolution GCMs can be sensitive to small perturbations in the dynamical equations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Y Y</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vorticity balance in coarse-resolution global ocean simulations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>605-622</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>24-degrees-n</keyword><keyword>abyssal circulation</keyword><keyword>currents</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>sverdrup balance</keyword><keyword>transport</keyword><keyword>world ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2504.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lu, Y.

The two simulations differ in their initial hydrographic conditions and surface wind and buoyancy forcing. The constrained simulation obtains optimal initial condition and surface forcing through assimilating observational data using the model's adjoint, whereas the unconstrained simulation uses Levitus climatological conditions for initialization and is driven by NCEP - NCAR reanalysis forcing, plus restoring to the monthly surface temperature and salinity climatological conditions. The goal is to examine the dynamics that sets the time-mean circulation and to understand the differences between the constrained and unconstrained simulations. It is found that, similar to eddy-permitting simulations, the bottom pressure torque (BPT) in coarse-resolution models plays an important role in the western boundary currents and in the Southern Ocean, and largely balances the difference between wind stress curl and betaV for the depth-integrated flow. BPT is a controlling factor of the interior abyssal flow. The geostrophic vorticity relation holds in the interior basins in intermediate and deep layers and breaks down in the upper ocean toward the surface. In the upper layer of the interior basins, the model simulations show statistically significant deviation from the Sverdrup balance. In the subtropical gyre regions, the deviation from Sverdrup balance is confined to zonal bands that are balanced by the curls of lateral friction and nonlinear advection. The differences between the constrained and unconstrained simulations are significant in vorticity terms. The adjustment to Levitus hydrographic climatological data as the model's initial condition causes the most significant changes in BPT, which is the main reason for changes in abyssal flow. The analysis also points to needs for further improvement of models and controlling the influence of data errors in ocean state estimation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marshall, J</author><author>Adcroft, A</author><author>Campin, J M</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>White, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atmosphere-ocean modeling exploiting fluid isomorphisms</title><secondary-title>Monthly Weather Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Monthly Weather Review</full-title></periodical><pages>2882-2894</pages><volume>132</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>coordinate</keyword><keyword>equations</keyword><keyword>gcm</keyword><keyword>general-circulation models</keyword><keyword>motion</keyword><keyword>representation</keyword><keyword>simulations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/mwr2835.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Marshall, J., A.

The global variability in the air-sea flux of carbon (+/-0.5 x 10(15) grams Carbon yr(-1) (PgC yr(-1))) is forced by changes of DeltapCO(2) and wind speeds related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle in the equatorial Pacific. In contrast the air-sea O-2 flux is controlled by two regions: the equatorial Pacific and North Atlantic. The model captures much of the interannual variability of the CO2 flux observed at Bermuda, with some correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. However, basin-scale air-sea CO2 flux anomalies are not correlated with the NAO due to a rapid neutralization of entrained DIC anomalies by biological uptake and export production in the subpolar gyre. CO2 flux variability estimates from our ocean model and the mean atmospheric inversion results of Bousquet et al. [2000] are in broad agreement in the equatorial Pacific, but not in the North Atlantic. This model suggests that the projection of air-sea flux anomalies onto the large-scale, mean air-sea flux pattern in atmospheric inversions may lead to an overestimate of the flux variability in the extra-tropics where the patterns of variability do not correspond to those of the mean flux.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reddy, P R C</author><author>Salvekar, P S</author><author>Deo, A A</author><author>Ganer, D W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Westward propagating twin gyres in the equatorial Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>31</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>rossby waves</keyword><keyword>somali current</keyword><keyword>southwest monsoon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003gl018615</electronic-resource-num><notes>Reddy, P.

Results are compared with estimates obtained in a traditional way from along-track SSH data at crossover points and with in situ, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements obtained on board the VOS Oleander along a nominal path connecting Bermuda with the U.S. mainland. Agreements with the Oleander data are reasonable when simultaneous (in space and time) sampling is available. However, amplitudes of parallel-track geostrophic velocity variances are about 25% lower as compared to Oleander measurements which represent geostrophic and ageostrophic flow components. Estimates of velocity variances show clear signs of an anisotropic eddy field in the vicinity of all major current systems. At the same time estimates of Reynolds stresses and eddy momentum fluxes show a convergence of eddy momentum in all those regions, suggesting a forcing of the mean flow by the eddy field there.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Ueyoshi, K</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Large, W G</author><author>Josey, S A</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating air-sea fluxes of heat, freshwater, and momentum through global ocean data assimilation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>109</volume><issue>C5</issue><keywords><keyword>air-sea fluxes</keyword><keyword>atmosphere</keyword><keyword>bulk parameterization</keyword><keyword>construction</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>layer</keyword><keyword>ncep</keyword><keyword>ocean synthesis</keyword><keyword>reanalyses</keyword><keyword>reanalysis project</keyword><keyword>satellite measurements</keyword><keyword>surface temperature</keyword><keyword>tropical ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003jc002082</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., K.

During the state estimation procedure, surface fluxes are adjusted together with initial temperature and salinity conditions so that the model simulation becomes consistent with ocean observations. Independent estimates of the adjustments from bulk formula and regional field observations are also employed to evaluate the results. Buoyancy flux adjustments are found to be within the crude prior error bars on these fields. Outside the boundary current regions, they are consistent with known large-scale deficiencies in the NCEP products. Wind stress adjustments are also everywhere within the prior error bars, but exhibit regional small-scale features that reflect ocean model failures to resolve intense boundary currents. On large scales, the inferred adjustments to NCEP wind stress fields are consistent with inferences made from satellite wind stress measurements. Further improvements in the surface flux estimates obtained through state estimation procedures are anticipated as the estimation procedure becomes more complete by including the use of improved prior error covariance information, and as the ocean model becomes more skillful, for example, in simulating boundary currents by increasing its resolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, O</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Cheng, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the cause of eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean T-S variations associated with El Nino</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>31</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>boundary</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>salinity variability</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004gl020188</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wang, O., I.

A validation of the ECCO model is performed by comparing model estimates of sea-level anomalies from tide-gauges with TOPEX/POSEIDON data, and ECCO model estimates of bottom pressure with those derived from temperature and salinity observations. The amplitudes of the ECCO sea-level anomaly are found to be 1.4 times smaller than observations; bottom pressure is 2 times smaller. Using a Green's functions approach to determine elastic deformations, the ECCO ocean bottom pressure is used to estimate surface displacements at the GPS sites. Model results were compared with the height series and with the observed NTOL effect. The height series and the predicted NTOL are highly correlated at all four stations. The analysis performed on superconducting gravimeter data at the Medicina station also shows high correlation.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biastoch, A</author><author>Kase, R H</author><author>Stammer, D B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The sensitivity of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge overflow to forcing changes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2307-2319</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>denmark strait</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>global ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>irminger seas</keyword><keyword>labrador</keyword><keyword>nordic seas</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>overflow</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(2003)033&lt;2307:tsotgr&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Biastoch, A., R.

The focus is on the sensitivity of cross-ridge transports and the reaction of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean circulation to changes in wind stress and buoyancy forcing on seasonal to interannual timescales. A general relation between changes in wind stress or cross-ridge density contrasts and the overturning transport of Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas source water is established from a series of idealized experiments. The relation is used subsequently to interpret changes in an experiment over the years 1992-97 with realistic forcing. On seasonal and interannual timescales there is a clear correlation between heat flux and wind stress curl variability. The realistic model suggests a steady decrease in the strength of the cyclonic subpolar gyre of the North Atlantic with a corresponding decrease in heat transport during the 1990s.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chao, B F</author><author>Au, A Y</author><author>Boy, J P</author><author>Cox, C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time-variable gravity signal of an anomalous redistribution of water mass in the extratropic Pacific during 1998-2002</title><secondary-title>Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems</full-title></periodical><volume>4</volume><keywords><keyword>J(2) anomaly</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>distribution</keyword><keyword>earth rotation</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>extratropic Pacific</keyword><keyword>field</keyword><keyword>geodesy and gravity : ocean/earth/atmosphere inter</keyword><keyword>interdecadal variability</keyword><keyword>lageos</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>oceanography : general : climate and interannual v</keyword><keyword>oscillation</keyword><keyword>time-variable gravity</keyword><keyword>water mass</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003gc000589</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chao, B.

Here we report that recent data show that J(2) has been rapidly returning toward &quot;normal'' (with PGR considered) since early 2001. In search of the geophysical and climatic causes for this &quot;1998-2002 J(2) anomaly,'' we report an oceanographic event that took place in the extratropic north and south Pacific basins that was found to match remarkably well with the time evolution of the anomaly. We examine the leading (nonseasonal, extratropic Pacific) Empirical Orthogonal Function/Principal Component modes in the sea-surface height (SSH) data from TOPEX/Poseidon, sea surface temperature (SST) data from the National Center for Environmental Predictions, and output fields of the Estimating the Circulation and the Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) ocean general circulation model (OGCM), including ocean bottom pressure (OBP) and temperature and salinity profiles. The phenomenon appears to be part of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and temporal correlations are made. However, quantitatively, the OBP field of the ECCO model predicts a J(2) anomaly that is smaller in magnitude than the observed by a factor of about 3. We discuss various possibilities for reconciling this discrepancy in terms of inadequacies of present OGCMs and considering other geophysical contributions; a complete resolution of the J(2) enigma awaits further studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fieguth, P W</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping and pseudoinverse algorithms for ocean data assimilation</title><secondary-title>Ieee Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ieee Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>43-51</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>altimeter data</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>climatological models</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>extended kalman filter</keyword><keyword>interscale transforms</keyword><keyword>pseudoinverse methods</keyword><keyword>remote sensing</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>sparse pseudoinverses</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific-ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/Tgrs.2002.808058</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fieguth, P.

In such reduced-state filters, the measurement update takes place on a coarser grid than that of the general circulation model (GCM); therefore, these filters require mapping operators from the GCM grid to the reduced state and vice versa. The general requirements are that the state-reduction and interpolation operators be pseudoinverses of each other, that the coarse state define a closed dynamical system, that the mapping operations be insensitive to noise, and that they be appropriate for regions with irregular coastlines and bathymetry. In this paper, we describe three efficient algorithms for computing the pseudoinverse: a fast Fourier transform algorithm that serves for illustration purposes, an exact implicit method that is recommended for most applications, and an efficient iterative algorithm that can be used for the largest problems. The mapping performance of 11 interpolation kernels is evaluated. Surprisingly, common kernels such as bilinear, exponential, Gaussian, and sine perform only moderately well. We recommend instead three kernels, smooth, thin-plate, and optimal interpolation, which have superior properties. This study removes the computational bottleneck of mapping and pseudoinverse algorithms and makes possible the application of reduced-state filters to global problems at state-of-the-art resolutions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gross, R S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atmospheric and oceanic excitation of the Earth's wobbles during 1980-2000</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><volume>108</volume><issue>B8</issue><keywords><keyword>angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>atmospheric angular momentum</keyword><keyword>base-line interferometry</keyword><keyword>chandler wobble</keyword><keyword>chandler-wobble</keyword><keyword>earth rotation</keyword><keyword>gravitational-field</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>oceanic angular momentum</keyword><keyword>orientation</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>polar motion excitation</keyword><keyword>rotation</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>short periodic variations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2002jb002143</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gross, R.

Here, the effectiveness of atmospheric and oceanic processes in exciting the Earth's wobbles during 1980-2000 is evaluated using estimates of atmospheric angular momentum from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis project and estimates of oceanic angular momentum from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium's simulation of the general circulation of the oceans. On intraseasonal timescales, atmospheric surface pressure changes are found to be the single most effective process exciting the Earth's wobbles, explaining about twice as much of the observed variance as do either atmospheric wind or ocean bottom pressure changes and nearly 4 times as much of the observed variance as do oceanic currents. However, on interannual timescales, ocean bottom pressure changes are found to be the single most effective process exciting the Earth's wobbles, explaining more than 5 times as much of the observed variance as do atmospheric wind and pressure changes combined, and more than twice as much of the observed variance as do oceanic currents. Within the Chandler band it is found that during 1980-2000 atmospheric and oceanic processes have enough power to excite the Chandler wobble and are significantly coherent with it. The single most important mechanism exciting the Chandler wobble is found to be ocean bottom pressure variations. Atmospheric and oceanic processes do not appear to have enough power to excite the Earth's wobbles to their observed levels on pentadal and longer timescales, although series longer than the 21-year long series used here need to be studied in order to obtain greater statistical significance of this result.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual-to-decadal variations of tropical-subtropical exchange in the Pacific Ocean: Boundary versus interior pycnocline transports</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>4022-4042</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>equatorial pacific</keyword><keyword>heat-content variability</keyword><keyword>indonesian throughflow</keyword><keyword>mindanao current</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north pacific</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>water exchange</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016&lt;4022:Ivotei&gt;2.0.Co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., and I.

The analysis focuses on the variability of pycnocline transports through the western boundary and interior near 10degreesN and 10degreesS. In contrast to time-mean exchange, where boundary and interior pycnocline transports are both equatorward, the variations of boundary and interior pycnocline transports are found to be generally anticorrelated to each other. Moreover, the variation of the boundary pycnocline transport is smaller than that of the interior, again different from time-mean exchange, where the boundary transport at 10degreesN is substantially larger than that through the interior. Interannual variations of the boundary and interior transports are consistent with near-surface geostrophic flow inferred from sea level data. Interior pycnocline flow into the Tropics is weaker in the 1990s than that in the 1980s, in agreement with recent observations. However, approximately half of it is compensated by an opposite change in boundary flow at 10degreesN. The results indicate that the interior pathway is more important to interannual and decadal variability of tropical - subtropical exchange than the boundary pathway, despite a much larger time-mean transport of the western boundary current at 10degreesN. To a large extent, the counteracting tendency of the boundary and interior flow and the larger variation of the latter can be explained by the combined effect of variability in off-equatorial wind stress curl in the western Pacific and near-equatorial zonal wind stress. The former changes the strength of horizontal circulation and results in a variation of boundary pycnocline flow that is opposite in direction but comparable in magnitude to that of the interior pycnocline flow. The latter primarily affects the strength of the shallow meridional overturning circulation with net pycnocline flow ( mostly in the interior) opposing the surface Ekman flow. The covariability of these two forcings leads to an enhancement of interior transport. The relative variability of boundary and interior pycnocline flow is insensitive to whether the Indonesian Throughflow is present or not.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Legg, S</author><author>Adcroft, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Internal wave breaking at concave and convex continental slopes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2224-2246</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>2 dimensions</keyword><keyword>deep-ocean</keyword><keyword>dissipation</keyword><keyword>finite topography</keyword><keyword>fluid</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>reflection</keyword><keyword>scattering</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(2003)033&lt;2224:iwbaca&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Legg, S., and A.

Previous analytic studies have suggested that shear enhancement is reduced at concave slopes as compared with convex and planar slopes near the critical angle. Here the internal wave reflection from concave and convex slopes that pass through the critical angle is investigated numerically using the nonhydrostatic Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm). Overturning, shear instability, and resultant mixing are examined. Results are compared with simulations of wave reflection from planar slopes with angles greater than, less than, and equal to the critical angle. In contrast to the analytic predictions, no reduction in mixing is found for the concave slope as compared with the other slopes. In all cases, stratification is eroded in a band above the slope, bounded at its outer edge by the internal wave characteristic. The difference between numerical and analytic results is caused by the nonlinearity of the numerical calculations, where the finite-amplitude flow leads to generation of upslope-propagating bores for a wide range of topographic slopes around the critical angle.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, X W</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Constraining the North Atlantic circulation between 4.5 degrees S and 39.5 degrees N with transient tracer observations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>108</volume><issue>C10</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint model</keyword><keyword>age</keyword><keyword>antarctic bottom water</keyword><keyword>chlorofluorocarbon</keyword><keyword>fresh-water transports</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>observations</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>rates</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword><keyword>transient tracer</keyword><keyword>tritium</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2002jc001765</electronic-resource-num><notes>Li, X.

The method of Lagrange multipliers (adjoint) is used. Tracer distribution within the model ocean interior is primarily sensitive to the flux through the open northern boundary. This flux is determined by the estimation method and is found to deviate from the initial estimate significantly for all tracers. An attempt to carry the model domain to 78.5degreesN showed the GCM inadequacy, believed to be primarily a problem of spatial resolution, to compute the convective injection of tracer into the deep ocean. Any such errors persist throughout the tracer integration and corrupt all further tracer concentrations. In general, and consistent with earlier much simpler computations, uncertainties in surface and northern boundary conditions dominate the computed tracer concentrations. The final results here are improved estimates of the three-dimensional time histories of the tritium and CFCs and their boundary conditions over the model domain, with very little information available to constrain the GCM itself in the latitude band.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Losch, M</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bottom topography as a control variable in an ocean model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1685-1696</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>explorer goce mission</keyword><keyword>fluxes</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>gravity-field</keyword><keyword>impact</keyword><keyword>parameters</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0426(2003)020&lt;1685:btaacv&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Losch, M., and C.

In neither case can all the details of the topography be recovered, showing that the relationship between topography and elevation does not have a unique inverse, and that many details of the topography are irrelevant to the particular physics under consideration.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Giering, R</author><author>Eckert, C</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Marotzke, J</author><author>Adcroft, A</author><author>Hill, C N</author><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Volume, heat, and freshwater transports of the global ocean circulation 1993-2000, estimated from a general circulation model constrained by World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>108</volume><issue>C1</issue><keywords><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>data assimilation analysis</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>fluxes</keyword><keyword>heat transport</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean reanalysis</keyword><keyword>passage</keyword><keyword>south-atlantic</keyword><keyword>surface fluxes</keyword><keyword>system</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2001jc001115</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., and Coauthors, 2003: Volume, heat, and freshwater transports of the global ocean circulation 1993-2000, estimated from a general circulation model constrained by World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) data.

Output from a data synthesis, or state estimation, method is used by which the model was forced to large-scale, time-varying global ocean data sets over 1993 through 2000. Time-mean horizontal transports, estimated from this fully time-dependent circulation, have converged with independent time-independent estimates from box inversions over most parts of the world ocean but especially in the southern hemisphere. However, heat transport estimates differ substantially in the North Atlantic where our estimates result in only 1/2 previous results. The models drift over the estimation period is consistent with observations from TOPEX/Poseidon in their spatial pattern, but smaller in their amplitudes by about a factor of 2. Associated temperature and salinity changes are complex, and both point toward air-sea interaction over water mass formation regions as the primary source for changes in the deep ocean. The estimated mean circulation around Australia involves a net volume transport of 11 Sv through the Indonesian Throughflow and the Mozambique Channel. In addition, we show that this flow regime exists on all timescales above 1 month, rendering the variability in the South Pacific strongly coupled to the Indian Ocean. Moreover, the dynamically consistent variations in the model show temporal variability of oceanic heat transports, heat storage, and atmospheric exchanges that are complex and with a strong dependence upon location, depth, and timescale. Our results demonstrate the great potential of an ocean state estimation system to provide a dynamical description of the time-dependent observed heat transport and heat content changes and their relation to air-sea interactions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McKinley, G A</author><author>Follows, M J</author><author>Marshall, J</author><author>Fan, S M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual variability of air-sea O-2 fluxes and the determination of CO2 sinks using atmospheric O-2/N-2</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>30</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>carbon-cycle</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>oxygen</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2002gl016044</electronic-resource-num><notes>McKinley, G.

Both fields will benefit. To this end, we present an ocean state estimation (data assimilation) framework which is designed to obtain a dynamically consistent picture of the changing ocean circulation by combining global ocean data sets of arbitrary type with a general circulation model (GCM). The impact of geoid measurements on such estimates of the ocean circulation are numerous. For the mean circulation, a precise geoid describes the reference frame for dynamical signals in altimetric sea surface height observations. For the time-varying ocean signal, changing geoid information might be a valuable new information about correcting the changing flow field on time scales from a few month to a year, but the quantitative utility of such information has not yet been demonstrated. For a consistent estimate, some knowledge of the prior error covariances of all data fields is required. The final result must be consistent with prior error estimates for the data. State estimation is thus one of the few quantitative consistency checks for new geoid measurements anticipated from forthcoming space missions. Practical quantitative methods will yield a best possible estimate of the dynamical sea surface which, when combined with satellite altimetric surfaces, will produce a best-estimate marine geoid. The anticipated accuracy and precision of such estimates raises some novel modeling error issues which have not conventionally been of concern (the Boussinesq approximation, self-attraction and loading). Model skill at very high frequencies is a major concern because of the need to de-alias the data obtained by the inevitable oceanic temporal undersampling dictated by realistic satellite orbit configurations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dickey, J O</author><author>Marcus, S L</author><author>de Viron, O</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recent Earth oblateness variations: Unraveling climate and postglacial rebound effects</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1975-1977</pages><volume>298</volume><issue>5600</issue><keywords><keyword>glaciers</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword><keyword>rotation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/Science.1077777</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dickey, J.

We have determined that the observed increases in J(2) are caused primarily by a recent surge in subpolar glacial melting and by mass shifts in the Southern, Pacific, and Indian oceans. When these effects are removed, the residual trend in J(2) (-2.9 x 10(-11) year(-1)) becomes consistent with previous estimates of PGR from satellite and eclipse data. The climatic significance of these rapid shifts in glacial and oceanic mass, however, remains to be investigated.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A partitioned Kalman filter and smoother</title><secondary-title>Monthly Weather Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Monthly Weather Review</full-title></periodical><pages>1370-1383</pages><volume>130</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>nino-southern oscillation</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation model</keyword><keyword>oceanography</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>topex/poseidon</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific-ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0493(2002)130&lt;1370:Apkfas&gt;2.0.Co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., 2002: A partitioned Kalman filter and smoother.

The method solves the larger estimation problem by partitioning it into a series of smaller calculations. Errors with small correlation distances are derived by regional approximations, and errors associated with independent processes are evaluated separately from one another. The overall uncertainty of the model state, as well as the Kalman filter and smoother, is approximated by the sum of the corresponding individual components. The resulting smaller dimensionality of each separate element renders application of Kalman filtering and smoothing to the larger problem much more practical than otherwise. In particular, the approximation makes high-resolution global eddy-resolving data assimilation computationally viable. The approach is described and its efficacy demonstrated using a simple one-dimensional shallow water model.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Giering, R</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Sloot, P</author><author>Tan, C J K</author><author>Dongarra, J J</author><author>Hoekstra, A G</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Automatic generation of efficient adjoint code for a parallel Navier-Stokes solver</title><secondary-title>Computational Science-Iccs 2002, Pt Ii, Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computational Science-Iccs 2002, Pt Ii, Proceedings</full-title></periodical><pages>1019-1028</pages><volume>2330</volume><keywords><keyword>construction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><pub-location>Berlin</pub-location><publisher>Springer-Verlag Berlin</publisher><isbn>0302-97433-540-43593-X</isbn><notes>Heimbach, P., C.

The task of minimizing a cost function measuring the ocean simulation vs. observation misfit is achieved through efficient calculation of the cost gradient w.r.t. a set of controls via the adjoint technique. The adjoint code of the parallel MIT general circulation model is generated using TAMC. To achieve a tractable problem in both CPU and memory requirements, despite the control flow, reversal, the adjoint code relies heavily on the balancing of storing vs. recomputation via the checkpointing method. Further savings are achieved by exploiting self-adjointedness of part of the computation. To retain scalability of the domain decomposition, handwritten adjoint routines are provided which complement routines of the parallel support package (such as inter-processor communications, global operations, active variable I/O) to perform corresponding operations in reverse mode. The size of the problem is illustrated for the global ocean estimation problem and results are given by way of example.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Menemenlis, D</author><author>Xing, Z F</author><author>Fu, L L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of the Indonesian Throughflow on the Pacific and Indian oceans</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1404-1429</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>appearance reality</keyword><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>north pacific</keyword><keyword>originate</keyword><keyword>parameterization</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(2002)032&lt;1404:Eotito&gt;2.0.Co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., I.

The ITF contributes to the maintenance of the model circulation system around eastern Australia and the southern Indian Ocean. Blockage of the ITF weakens the Indian Ocean South Equatorial Current and Agulhas Current and strengthens the East Australian Current. The ITF does not affect the Mindanao Current, but drains waters carried by this current into the Indian Ocean and thus reduces tropical-subtropical exchange in the North Pacific. Meanwhile, it helps maintain a stronger New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent and thus enhances tropical-subtropical exchange in the south. Water parcels traveling along the western boundary of the South Pacific cross the equator in the presence of the ITF but are confined to the Southern Hemisphere without the ITF. The southern &quot;exchange window'' in which subducted waters can reach the Tropics is wider with than without the ITF. Some parcels from the southern subtropics can reach the Tropics with open ITF, but recirculate back to the subtropical gyre when the ITF is closed. These &quot;excess'' recirculated parcels reach several degrees farther south and outcrop north of Tasmania. The consequence on sea surface temperature (SST) there may have an important implication to the local climate. Blockage of the ITF depresses the mean thermocline of the tropical Pacific, increases SST in the central to eastern equatorial Pacific, and thus reduces the SST difference between the warm pool and cold tongue. It also raises the mean thermocline of the Indian Ocean (especially the southern Indian Ocean) and decreases SST in the southern Indian Ocean. Blockage of the ITF reduces seasonal-to-interannual thermocline fluctuations in the central to eastern equatorial Pacific because the resulting deeper thermocline attenuates fluctuations in response to local Ekman pumping. The opposite is true in the southern Indian Ocean for the interannual timescale. However, seasonal thermocline fluctuation in that area is weakened when the ITF is blocked (despite a shallower thermocline). It indicates that local Ekman pumping is not the dominant mechanism controlling seasonal thermocline variability there as previously suggested. Radiation of planetary waves from the ITF area and advection by the ITF-dependent South Equatorial Current could also be important. Blockage of the ITF also reduces interannual variability of SST in the eastern equatorial Pacific and enhances those in the tropical southern Indian Ocean and south of Tasmania. The results indicate that the ITF may affect El Nino-Southern Oscillation by modifying tropical-subtropical exchanges, mean tropical thermocline structure, mean SST difference between the warm pool and cold tongue, and seasonal-to-interannual variabilities of thermocline depth and SST.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, Detlef</author><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State estimation improves prospects for ocean research</title><secondary-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</full-title></periodical><pages>289-295</pages><volume>83</volume><issue>27</issue><keywords><keyword>4294 Instruments and techniques</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2002EO000207</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., C.

At the cost of increased computational load, the estimation (assimilation) method is chosen specifically so that the resulting state estimate is consistent with the model equations, having no artificial sources or sinks. To bring the model into close agreement with observations, its initial temperature and salinity conditions are permitted to change, as are the time-dependent surface fluxes of momentum, heat and freshwater. Resulting changes of these &quot;control vectors'' are largely consistent with accepted uncertainties in the hydrographic climatology and meteorological analyses. The assimilation procedure is able to correct for many of the traditional shortcomings of the flow field by changing the surface boundary conditions. Changes in the resulting flow field are predominantly on the gyre scale and affect many features that are often poorly simulated in traditional numerical simulations, such as the strengths of the Gulf Stream and its extension, the Azores Current and the anticyclonic circulation associated with the Labrador Sea. Tests of the results and their consistency with prior error assumptions show that the constrained model has moved considerably closer to the observations imposed as constraints, but has also moved closer to independent data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment not used in the assimilation procedure. In some regions where the comparisons remain indeterminate, not enough ocean observations are available, and it is difficult to ascribe the residuals to either the model or the observations. Although problems remain, a useful first solution to the global time-dependent ocean state estimation problem has been found. The estimates will continue to improve through the evolution of numerical models, computer power increases, more data, and more efficient estimation methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What is the thermohaline circulation?</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1179-+</pages><volume>298</volume><issue>5596</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1079329</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2002: What is the thermohaline circulation?

This richness tends to make interpretation of observations, which are inevitably thin in both space and time, difficult, in contrast to the situation in modeling studies. At least six different timescales and corresponding space scales can appear in one-dimensional problems. In higher dimensions the number of scales increases. Several examples of analytical and numerical solutions are explored for the light they cast on understanding a fluid flow. Boundary Green functions emerge as the fundamental physical/mathematical link between interior tracer distributions and surface and other boundary variations. With transient tracers in inverse calculations one should normally use the underlying tracer distributions to attempt to solve for fundamental fluid properties, such as the mixing coefficients, rather than ambiguous &quot;ventilation'' times, which among other problems, may be determined only by the detection threshold and are often mainly functions of the tracer decay constant rather than of fluid properties. Tracers that are transient only through stochastic boundary conditions show that large-scale space/time patterns can emerge in the tracer field, having little or no clear connection to the underlying fluid flow.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adcroft, A</author><author>Scott, J R</author><author>Marotzke, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of geothermal heating on the global ocean circulation</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>1735-1738</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>abyssal</keyword><keyword>energetics</keyword><keyword>flow</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>wind</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2000gl012182</electronic-resource-num><notes>Adcroft, A., J.

A simplified, two-layer bio-physical model reveals regional responses to interannual variability of convective mixing. Vertical mixing can promote productivity in the surface waters through enhanced nutrient supply, but also can retard productivity due to the transport of phytoplankton below Sverdrup's critical depth. The balance of these processes determines the regimes of response in the two-layer model. The regimes may be identified by the ratio of the thickness of Sverdrup's critical layer during spring and the end of winter mixed layer, h(c)/h(m). The responses predicted by the simplified model are found in a more sophisticated four-compartment, nitrogen-based ecosystem model, driven by a general circulation model of the North Atlantic. Anomalously strong convective mixing leads to enhanced chlorophyll concentrations in regions of shallow mixed layers (h(c)/h(m) similar to 1), such as the subtropics. In contrast, in the subpolar regions, where mixed layers are deeper (h(c)/h(m) much less than 1), the sensitivity to convective mixing is weaker, and increased mixing can lead to lower phytoplankton abundances. The numerical model also reveals regions of more complex behavior, such as the inter-gyre boundary, where advective supply of nutrients plays a significant role on interannual timescales. Preliminary analyses of in situ and remote observations from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series, Ocean Weather Station &quot;India&quot; and the Coastal Zone Color Scanner also show qualitative agreement. The conceptual framework provides a tool for the analysis of ongoing remote ocean-color observations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This chapter provides an overview of data assimilation with an emphasis on applications to analyzing satellite altimeter data. The problem of data assimilation belongs to the wider field of estimation and control theories. The estimates of the dynamic system are improved by correcting model errors with the observations on the one hand and synthesizing observations by the models on the other. Much of the original mathematical theory of data assimilation was developed in the context of ballistics applications. Data assimilation is an emerging area in oceanography, stimulated by recent improvements in computational and modeling capabilities and the increase in the amount of available oceanographic observations. The continuing increase in computational capabilities have made numerical ocean modeling a commonplace. One of the central merits of data assimilation is its extraction of oceanographic signals from incomplete and noisy observations. Most oceanographic measurements—including altimetry—are characterized by their sparseness in space and time compared to the inherent scales of ocean variability; this translates into noisy and gappy measurements.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirose, N</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Ponte, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A non-isostatic global sea level response to barometric pressure near 5 days</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>2441-2444</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>normal-modes</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>waves</keyword><keyword>world ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2001gl012907</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hirose, N., I.

Nonisostatic signals are, however, observed at many tropical tide gauges at periods near 5 days. Our analysis of satellite observations reveals the global nature of these signals, involving nonisostatic sea level fluctuations with nearly uniform phase within separate basins and an out-of-phase oscillation between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Comparisons with a barotropic model further link the observed signals to forcing by a large scale pressure wave in the atmosphere and show that constrictions between basins prevent an isostatic response from being established. The apparent forced, nonresonant nature of the nonisostatic response contrasts with the predominantly resonant ocean dynamics at higher frequencies and may be relevant to explain the behavior of the long period tides.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirose, N</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Zlotnicki, V</author><author>Ponte, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling the high-frequency barotropic response of the ocean to atmospheric disturbances: Sensitivity to forcing, topography, and friction</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>30987-30995</pages><volume>106</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>sea-level variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2000jc000763</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hirose, N., I.

Optimal model performance, defined in terms of the explained variance in satellite altimeter and bottom pressure data, is found when using relatively strong friction, equivalent to a damping timescale of only a few days over the deep ocean, and topography with minimal smoothing. Spatial variations of the optimal friction parameter seem to reflect the roughness of bottom topography. The model demonstrates skill in simulating the wind-driven response as well as the nonequilibrium response to atmospheric pressure variations.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kase, R H</author><author>Biastoch, A</author><author>Stammer, D B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Mid-Depth Circulation in the Labrador and Irminger Seas</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>3433-3436</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>north-atlantic ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2001gl013192</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kase, R.

This heating is parameterized as a spatially uniform heat flux of 50 mW m(-2) through the (flat) ocean floor, in contrast with previous studies that have considered regional circulation changes caused by an isolated hot spot or a series of plumes along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In our model results the equilibrated response is largely advective: a deep perturbation of the meridional overturning cell on the order of several sverdrups is produced, connecting with an upper level circulation at high latitudes, allowing the additional heat to be released to the atmosphere. Rising motion in the perturbation deep cell is concentrated near the equator. The upward penetration of this cell is limited by the thermocline, analogous to the role of the stratosphere in limiting the upward penetration of convective plumes in the atmosphere. The magnitude of the advective response is inversely proportional to the deep stratification; with a weaker background meridional overturning circulation and a less stratified abyss the overturning maximum of the perturbation deep cell is increased. This advective response also cools the low-latitude thermocline. The qualitative behavior is similar in both a single-hemisphere and a double-hemisphere configuration. In summary, the anomalous circulation driven by geothermal fluxes is more substantial than previously thought. We are able to understand the structure and strength of the response in the idealized geometry and further extend these ideas to explain the results of Adcroft et al. [2001], where the impact of geothermal heating was examined using a global configuration.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Bleck, R</author><author>Boening, C</author><author>DeMey, P</author><author>Hurlburt, H</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Le Provost, C</author><author>Tokmakian, R</author><author>Webb, D</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Koblinsky, C J</author><author>Smith, N R</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Ocean Modeling and State Estimation in Support of Climate Research</title><secondary-title>Observing the Oceans in the 21st Century</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Observing the Oceans in the 21st Century</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><pub-location>Melbourne, Australia</pub-location><publisher>GODAE Project Office and Bureau of Meteorology</publisher><notes>Stammer, D., and Coauthors, 2001: Global Ocean Modeling and State Estimation in Support of Climate Research.

Model data consistency is examined. Impact of the assimilation on forecast is evaluated. The ocean component of the coupled model consists of a shallow water model with two baroclinic modes, an Ekman shear layer, and a mixed layer temperature equation. The atmospheric model is a statistical one (based on dominant covariance of historical surface temperature and pseudo wind stress anomaly data). The adjoint method is used to fit the coupled model to 6 months of data by optimally adjusting the initial state and model parameters. A forecast is performed using the end state of an assimilation experiment as initial conditions and using parameters estimated during the assimilation period. Thus the model state during the assimilation and that during the forecast belong to the same model trajectory in different periods. Such an initialization procedure is useful in avoiding initial shock during forecast due to inconsistency of an initial state with the coupled model physics. As a result of optimal adjustments of initial state and parameters, the model is able to reproduce observed interannual variability of sea surface temperature and sea level reasonably well. The averaged residual model data misfits over various 6 month periods are 0.5 degreesC and 5 cm, respectively. The model has a limited skill in reproducing much of the off-equatorial wind anomalies. The residual model data misfit in pseudo wind stress anomaly is larger than 10 m(2) s(-2). Forecasts initialized from the assimilation product are overall more realistic than those simply initialized from wind-forced ocean states. Consistent improvement due to optimal initialization is found for sea surface temperature and sea level anomalies in the central-eastern Pacific and zonal pseudo wind stress anomaly in the central Pacific, both in terms of root-mean-squared deviation from and correlation with the data. The adjustments of parameters in addition to initial state in a coupled context is found to be important to improving the model data consistency during the assimilation and the forecast. In particular, the estimated drag and damping coefficients properly regulate the relative strength of forcing and damping of the ocean state so as to fit the three types of observations during the assimilation (initialization) period, which facilitates the development of a large-amplitude warming event during the forecast. The study demonstrates the utility of oceanic and atmospheric data to estimate initial state and model parameters in a coupled context, which is useful to the evaluation, improvement, and initialization of El Nino-Southern Oscillation forecast models.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McKinley, G A</author><author>Follows, M J</author><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual variability of the air-sea flux of oxygen in the North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>2933-2936</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>cycle</keyword><keyword>energy</keyword><keyword>models</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>ratio</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2000gl011492</electronic-resource-num><notes>McKinley, G.

We begin to address the validity of this assumption by investigating the magnitude and mechanisms of interannual variability in the flux of oxygen across the sea surface using a North Atlantic biogeochemical model. The model, based on the MIT ocean general circulation model, captures the gross patterns and seasonal cycle of nutrients and oxygen within the basin. The air-sea oxygen flux exhibits significant interannual variability in the North Atlantic, with a standard deviation (0.36 mol m(-2) y(-1)) that is a large fraction of the mean (0.85 mol m(-2) y(-1)). This is primarily a consequence of variability in winter convection in the subpolar gyre.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Chechelnitsky, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Error Estimates for an Ocean General Circulation Model from Altimeter and Acoustic Tomography Data</title><secondary-title>Monthly Weather Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Monthly Weather Review</full-title></periodical><pages>763-778</pages><volume>128</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0493(2000)128&lt;0763:EEFAOG&gt;2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Menemenlis, D., and M.

This covariance matching approach is both a powerful diagnostic tool for addressing theoretical questions and an efficient estimator for real data assimilation studies. Provided that model and data errors are independent, that error propagation is approximately linear, and that an observability condition is met, it is in theory possible to fully resolve covariance matrices for both model and data errors. In practice, however, due to large uncertainties in sample estimates of covariance matrices, the number of statistically significant parameters that can be estimated is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the total number of independent observations. The covariance matching approach is applied in the North Pacific (5°–60°N, 132°–252°E) to TOPEX/Poseidon sea level anomaly data, acoustic tomography data from the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate Project, and a GCM. A reduced state linear model that describes large-scale internal (baroclinic) error dynamics is constructed. Twin experiments suggest that altimetric data are ill suited to estimating the statistics of the vertical GCM error structure, but that such estimates can in theory be obtained using acoustic data. The particular GCM integration exhibits a warming trend relative to TOPEX/Poseidon data of order 1 cm yr−1 corresponding to a peak warming of up to 0.2°C yr−1 in the acoustic data at depths ranging from 50 to 200 m. At the annual cycle, GCM and TOPEX/Poseidon sea level anomaly are in phase, but GCM amplitude is 2 cm smaller, with the error confined above 200-m depth. After removal of trends and annual cycles, the low-frequency/wavenumber (periods &gt;2 months, wavelengths &gt;16°) TOPEX/Poseidon sea level anomaly is order 6 cm2. The GCM explains about 40% of that variance. By covariance matching, it is estimated that 60% of the GCM–TOPEX/Poseidon residual variance is consistent with the reduced state linear model.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Chassignet, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean State Estimation and Prediction in Support of Oceanographic Research</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>51-56</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2000.34</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., and E.

Giering's software tool Tangent-Linear and Adjoint Model Compiler (TAMC). The TAMC's recipe for (FORTRAN-) line-by-line generation of adjoint code is explained by interpreting an adjoint model strictly as the operator that gives the sensitivity of the output of a model to its input. Then, the sensitivity of 1993 annual mean heat transport across 29 degrees N in the Atlantic, to the hydrography on January 1, 1993, is calculated from a global solution of the GCM. The &quot;kinematic sensitivity&quot; to initial temperature variations is isolated, showing how the latter would influence heat transport if they did not affect the density and hence the flow. Over 1 year the heat transport at 29 degrees N is influenced kinematically from regions up to 20 degrees upstream in the western boundary current and up to 5 degrees upstream in the interior. In contrast, the dynamical influences of initial temperature (and salinity) perturbations spread from as far as the rim of the Labrador Sea to the 29 degrees N section along the western boundary. The sensitivities calculated with the adjoint compare excellently to those from a perturbation calculation with the dynamical model. Perturbations in initial interior salinity influence meridional overturning and heat transport when they have propagated to the western boundary and can thus influence the integrated east-west density difference. Our results support the notion that boundary monitoring of meridional mass and heat transports is feasible.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, K Q</author><author>Marotzke, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The importance of open-boundary estimation for an Indian Ocean GCM-data synthesis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Marine Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Marine Research</full-title></periodical><pages>305-334</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>flows</keyword><keyword>fluxes</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>heat-transport</keyword><keyword>hydrographic section</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic model</keyword><keyword>steady-state</keyword><keyword>throughflow</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1357/002224099321618236</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhang, K.

Open boundary conditions are implemented to the west of the Indonesian Archipelago and near 30S. The approach simultaneously optimizes the initial conditions of the hydrographic fields, surface fluxes, and the open boundary conditions (temperature, salinity, and horizontal velocities). Compared to previous results obtained in a closed domain, the estimated velocity field shows a marked improvement near the southern boundary, with a reasonably strong Agulhas Current leaving the model domain. The Indonesian throughflow (ITF) is estimated as 2.7 Sv (1 Sv is 10(6) m(3)/s) westward, which is on the low end of the range of previous estimates. The model is able to sharpen fronts in surface salinity, compared to climatology, and suggests that the low surface salinity values in the eastern equatorial region arise from advection out of the Bay of Bengal rather than from the ITF. Consistent with the closed-domain results, the meridional overturning is dominated by a shallow (above 500 m), wind-driven cell of 16 Sv maximum, which carries the bulk of the southward heat transport. We have defined generalizations of meridional heat and freshwater transports appropriate in the presence of a throughflow. The estimated meridional heat transport has a maximum of 0.8 PW at 12S, maximum freshwater transport is 0.29 Sv southward at 9S. The meridional transport divergences are well balanced by the surface heat and freshwater fluxes, indicating near-steady state and small influence of the ITF.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>The ATOC Consortium</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Climate Change: Comparison of Acoustic Tomography, Satellite Altimetry, and Modeling</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1327 LP - 1332</pages><volume>281</volume><issue>5381</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.281.5381.1327</electronic-resource-num><notes>The ATOC Consortium, 1998: Ocean Climate Change: Comparison of Acoustic Tomography, Satellite Altimetry, and Modeling.

Interpreting climate change signals from fluctuations in sea level is therefore complicated. The annual cycle of heat flux is 150 ± 25 watts per square meter (peak-to-peak, corresponding to a 0.2°C vertically averaged temperature cycle); an interannual change of similar magnitude is also detected.

The principal advantages of the multiresolution scheme are its high computational efficiency, the requirement for explicit statistical models for the oceanographic signal and the measurement errors, and the production of error variances for all estimates at multiple scales. A set of Matlab-callable routines that implement the multiresolution scheme have been made available via anonymous FTP. The oceanographic signal is here modeled as a stationary 1/kμ process, where k is the horizontal wavenumber. Measurement noise is modeled as the sum of two separate random processes: a Gaussian white noise process and a correlated process of a low wavenumber representing the uncertainties in the orbital position of the satellite and in the atmospheric load corrections. The efficiency of the multiresolution scheme allowed the testing of more than 16000 sets of hypothesized statistical prior model parameters to determine the most likely parameters. Mapping results with and without low wavenumber error corrections are presented and compared.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Raghunath, R</author><author>Fu, L L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nature of global large-scale sea level variability in relation to atmospheric forcing: A modeling study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>5493-5512</pages><volume>103</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword><keyword>wind-stress</keyword><keyword>world ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/97jc02907</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., R.

A global primitive equation model of the ocean is forced by daily winds and climatological heat fluxes corresponding to the period from January 1992 to January 1994. The physical nature of sea level's temporal variability from periods of days to a year is examined on the basis of spectral analyses of model results and comparisons with satellite altimetry and tide gauge measurements. The study elucidates and diagnoses the inhomogeneous physics of sea level change in space and frequency domain. At midlatitudes, large-scale sea level variability is primarily due to steric changes associated with the seasonal heating and cooling cycle of the surface layer. In comparison, changes in the tropics and high latitudes are mainly wind driven. Wind-driven variability exhibits a strong latitudinal dependence in itself. Wind-driven changes are largely baroclinic in the tropics but barotropic at higher latitudes. Baroclinic changes are dominated by the annual harmonic of the first baroclinic mode and is largest off the equator; variabilities associated with equatorial waves are smaller in comparison. Wind-driven barotropic changes exhibit a notable enhancement over several abyssal plains in the Southern Ocean, which is likely due to resonant planetary wave modes in basins semienclosed by discontinuities in potential vorticity. Otherwise, barotropic sea level changes are typically dominated by high frequencies with as much as half the total variance in periods shorter than 20 days, reflecting the frequency spectra of wind stress curl. Implications of the findings with regards to analyzing observations and data assimilation are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Marotzke, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal cycles of meridional overturning and heat transport of the Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>923-943</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>deep currents</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>fluxes</keyword><keyword>monsoon</keyword><keyword>somali current</keyword><keyword>south</keyword><keyword>throughflow</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(1998)028&lt;0923:scomoa&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., and J.

Interannual variability is minimized by penalizing the temporal drift from one seasonal cycle to another during a two-year integration. The resultant meridional overturning and heat transport display large seasonal variations, with maximum amplitudes of 18 and 22 (x 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) for the overturning and 1.8 and 1.4 (x 10(15) W) for heat transport near 10 degrees S and 10 degrees N, respectively. A dynamical decomposition of the overturning and heat transport shows that the rime-varying Ekman flow plus its barotropic compensation can explain a large parr of the seasonal variations in overturning and heat transport. The maximum variations at 10 degrees N and 10 degrees S are associated with monsoon reversal over the northern Indian Ocean and changes of the easterlies over the southern Indian Ocean. An external mode with variable topography has a moderate contribution where the Somali Current and the corresponding gyre reverse direction seasonally. Contribution from vertical shear (thermal wind and ageostrophic shear) is dominant near the southern boundary and large near the Somali Current latitudes. The dominant balance in the zonally integrated heat budget is between heat storage change and heat transport convergence except south of 15 degrees S. Optimization with seasonal forcings improves estimates of sea surface temperatures, but the annual average overturning and heat transport are very similar to previous results with annual mean forcings. The annual average heat transport consists of roughly equal contributions from time-mean and time-varying fields of meridional velocities and temperatures in the northern Indian Ocean, indicating a significant rectification to the hear transport due to the time-varying fields. The time-mean and time-varying contributions are primarily due to the overturning and horizontal gyre, respectively. Inclusion of TOPEX data enhances the seasonal cycles of the estimated overturning and heat transport in the central Indian Ocean significantly and improves the estimated equatorial zonal flows but leads to unrealistic estimates of the velocity structure near the Indonesian Throughflow region, most likely owing to the deficiencies in the lateral boundary conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Marotzke, Jochem</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inferring meridional mass and heat transports of the Indian Ocean by fitting a general circulation model to climatological data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>10585-10602</pages><volume>102</volume><issue>C5</issue><keywords><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>steady-state</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/97JC00464</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., and J.

By estimating target temperatures and salinities near the artificially closed side boundaries as part of the optimization procedure, a steady solution that is consistent with climatological data within limits of observational errors is found. The resultant meridional overturning is vigorous (14 Sv; 1 Sv = 10(6) m(3)/s) only in the upper 1000 m. The estimated deep inflow entering the Indian Ocean from the south is weak. Requiring a large net northward inflow at depth does not result in strong inferior upwelling but leads to unrealistically large baroclinic mass exchange and implied vertical mixing near the Indonesian throughflow region. The shallow overturning is the main carrier of the southward heat transport, which has a maximum of 0.8 PW (1 PW = 10(15) W) near 15 degrees S. Wind forcing plays a key role in driving the estimated overturning of the Indian Ocean. This result is in disagreement with previous interpretations about the central role of surface heat flux in driving a vigorous deep overturning of the Indian Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Adcroft, Alistair</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Perelman, Lev</author><author>Heisey, Curt</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A finite-volume, incompressible Navier Stokes model for studies of the ocean on parallel computers</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>5753-5766</pages><volume>102</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>equations</keyword><keyword>sigma</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/96JC02775</electronic-resource-num><notes>Marshall, J., A.

A ''pressure correction'' method is used which is solved as a Poisson equation for the pressure field with Neumann boundary conditions in a geometry as complicated as that of the ocean basins. A major objective of the study is to make this inversion, and hence nonhydrostatic ocean modeling, efficient on parallel computers. The pressure field is separated into surface, hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic components. First, as in hydrostatic models, a two-dimensional problem is inverted for the surface pressure which is then made use of in the three-dimensional inversion for the nonhydrostatic pressure. Preconditioned conjugate-gradient iteration is used to invert symmetric elliptic operators in both two and three dimensions. Physically motivated preconditioners are designed which are efficient at reducing computation and minimizing communication between processors. Our method exploits the fact that as the horizontal scale of the motion becomes very much larger than the vertical scale, the motion becomes more and more hydrostatic and the three-dimensional Poisson operator becomes increasingly anisotropic and dominated by the vertical axis. Accordingly, a preconditioner is used which, in the hydrostatic limit, is an exact integral of the Poisson operator and so leads to a single algorithm that seamlessly moves from nonhydrostatic to hydrostatic limits. Thus in the hydrostatic limit the model is ''fast,'' competitive with the fastest ocean climate models in use today based on the hydrostatic primitive equations. But as the resolution is increased, the model dynamics asymptote smoothly to the Navier Stokes equations and so can be used to address small-scale processes. A ''finite-volume'' approach is employed to discretize the model in space in which property fluxes are defined normal to faces that delineate the volumes. The method makes possible a novel treatment of the boundary in which cells abutting the bottom or coast may take on irregular shapes and be ''shaved'' to fit the boundary. The algorithm can conveniently exploit massively parallel computers and suggests a domain decomposition which allocates vertical columns of ocean to each processing unit. The resulting model, which can handle arbitrarily complex geometry, is efficient and scalable and has been mapped on to massively parallel multiprocessors such as the Connection Machine (CM5) using data-parallel FORTRAN and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology data-flow machine MONSOON using the implicitly parallel language Id.</abstract></record><record><database name="collection.enl" path="collection.enl">collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marshall, J</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Perelman, L</author><author>Adcroft, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrostatic, quasi-hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic ocean modeling</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>5733-5752</pages><volume>102</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>equations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/96jc02776</electronic-resource-num><notes>Marshall, J., C.

The quasi-hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic sets are more accurate than the widely used hydrostatic primitive equations. Quasi-hydrostatic models relax the precise balance between gravity and pressure gradient forces by including in a consistent manner cosine-of-latitude Coriolis terms which are neglected in primitive equation models. Nonhydrostatic models employ the full incompressible Navier Stokes equations; they are required in the study pf small-scale phenomena in the ocean which are not in hydrostatic balance. We outline a solution strategy for the Navier Stokes model on the sphere that performs efficiently across the whole range of scales in the ocean, from the convective scale to the global scale, and so leads to a model of great versatility. In;he hydrostatic limit the Navier Stokes' model involves no more computational effort than those models which assume strict hydrostatic balance on all scales. The strategy is illustrated in simulations of laboratory experiments in rotating convection on scales of a few centimeters, simulations of convective and baroclinic instability of the mixed layer on the 1- to 10-km scale, and simulations of the global circulation of the ocean.</abstract></record></records></xml>
