Under historical greenhouse warming, regional ocean currents show diverse tendencies, but whether there is an emerging trend of the global mean ocean circulation system is not yet clear. Here, we show a statistically significant increasing trend in the globally integrated oceanic kinetic energy since the early 1990s, indicating a substantial acceleration of global mean ocean circulation. The increasing trend in kinetic energy is particularly prominent in the global tropical oceans, reaching depths of thousands of meters. The deep-reaching acceleration of the ocean circulation is mainly induced by a planetary intensification of surface winds since the early 1990s. Although possibly influenced by wind changes associated with the onset of a negative Pacific decadal oscillation since the late 1990s, the recent acceleration is far larger than that associated with natural variability, suggesting that it is principally part of a long-term trend.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Quinn, K J</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean angular momentum from a recent global state estimate, with assessment of uncertainties</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><pages>584-597</pages><volume>216</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><notes>Quinn, K.

We analyse a new OAM series (1992–2015) based on the solution of a global general circulation model constrained to most existing ocean data. The impact of the data-constrained optimization on OAM is substantial, and particularly essential for calculating effects of global mean ocean mass changes, which can be important for determining annual cycles and long term trends in OAM. The contributions of sea ice to OAM variations, also estimated, are found to be negligible. Uncertainties in OAM series are assessed by comparison with other available estimates. Results indicate low signal-to-noise ratios for all the analysed OAM series. Comparisons with geodetic, atmospheric and hydrologic data, in the context of the planetary angular momentum budget, point to the continued need for improvements in some or all of the series. Possible paths are offered for producing better OAM estimates in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Quran</author><author>Zhang, Xuebin</author><author>Church, John A</author><author>Hu, Jianyu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ENSO-Related Global Ocean Heat Content Variations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>45-68</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0861.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wu, Q., Zhang, X., Church, J.

However, the quantitative results and the mechanisms at work remain uncertain. Here, a dynamically consistent ocean state estimate is utilized to study the large-scale integrated heat content variations during ENSO events for the global ocean. The full-depth GOHC exhibits a cooling tendency during the peak and decaying phases of El Niño, which is a result of the negative surface heat flux (SHF) anomaly in the tropics (30°S–30°N), partially offset by the positive SHF anomaly at higher latitudes. The tropical SHF anomaly acts as a lagged response to damp the convergence of oceanic heat transport, which redistributes heat from the extratropics and the subsurface layers (100–440 m) into the upper tropical oceans (0–100 m) during the onset and peak of El Niño. These results highlight the global nature of the oceanic heat redistribution during ENSO events, as well as how the redistribution process affects the full-depth GOHC. The meridional heat exchange across 30°S and 30°N is driven by ocean current anomalies, while multiple processes contribute to the vertical heat exchange across 100 m simultaneously. Heat advection due to unbalanced mass transport is distinguished from the mass balanced one, with significant contributions from the meridional and zonal overturning cells being identified for the latter in the vertical direction. Results presented here have implications for monitoring the planetary energy budget and evaluating ENSO’s global imprints on ocean heat content in different estimates.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Callaghan, B.</author><author>Chabchoub, A.</author><author>Waseda, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Marine current energy in Eastern Australia: Evolution of currents and mesoscale anticyclonic eddies</title><secondary-title>Advances in Renewable Energies Offshore</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Renewable Energies Offshore</full-title></periodical><pages>31-38</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>London</pub-location><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis Group</publisher><isbn>978-1-138-58535-5</isbn><notes>O’Callaghan, B., Chabchoub, A., &amp;amp; Waseda, T.

Here we report on simulations using NASAs Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS-5) which was used to evaluate the consistency of two different sets of observationally constrained land and ocean fluxes with atmospheric CO2 records. Despite the strong data constraint, the average difference in annual terrestrial biosphere flux between the two land (NASA Ames CASA and CASA-GFED) models is 1.7 Pg C for 2009-2010. Ocean models (NOBM and ECCO2-Darwin) differ by 35 in their global estimates of carbon flux with particularly strong disagreement in high latitudes. Based upon combinations of terrestrial and ocean fluxes, GEOS-5 reasonably simulated the seasonal cycle observed at northern hemisphere surface sites and by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) while the model struggled to simulate the seasonal cycle at southern hemisphere surface locations. Though GEOS-5 was able to reasonably reproduce the patterns of XCO2 observed by GOSAT, it struggled to reproduce these aspects of AIRS observations. Despite large differences between land and ocean flux estimates, resulting differences in atmospheric mixing ratio were small, typically less than 5 ppmv at the surface and 3 ppmv in the XCO2 column. A statistical analysis based on the variability of observations shows that flux differences of these magnitudes are difficult to distinguish from natural variability, regardless of measurement platform.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cessi, Paola</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Global Overturning Circulation</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Marine Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Marine Science</full-title></periodical><pages>249-270</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-marine-010318-095241</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cessi, P.

I also review recent conceptual models of the oceanic meridional overturning circulation and of the mid-depth and abyssal stratification. These theories show that dynamics in the Antarctic circumpolar region are essential in determining the deep and abyssal stratification.

This coastal warming is highly unusual in that it took place with a weak La Niña state. Observations and ocean model experiments show that the downwelling Kelvin waves caused by strong westerly wind events over the equatorial Pacific, together with anomalous northerly coastal winds, are important. Atmospheric model experiments further show the anomalous coastal winds are forced by the coastal warming. Taken together, these results indicate a positive feedback off Peru between the coastal warming, atmospheric deep convection, and the coastal winds. These coupled processes provide predictability. Indeed, initialized on as early as 1 February 2017, seasonal prediction models captured the extreme rainfall event. Climate model projections indicate that the frequency of extreme coastal El Niño will increase under global warming.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Trossman, D.

The present study examines whether a depth integral of the ocean's electrical conductivity (?conductance?), which may be inferred from both in situ methods and satellite magnetometers over the global ocean, could help monitor OHC. The ocean's electrical conductivity locally depends on temperature, salinity, and pressure, but it is not as well known how the conductance depends on OHC and ocean salt content. By examining the output of an ocean state estimate shown to agree well with observations that have not been assimilated, this study evaluates the fundamental limitations of using perfectly known ocean conductance to predict OHC, rather than the challenges associated with accounting for observational error. It is found that the ocean's conductance and OHC fields are nonlinearly related but nevertheless highly correlated. A statistical framework tends to predict OHC more accurately than ocean salt content from ocean conductance in regions where conductivity is more sensitive to salinity than temperature. The annually (bidecadally) averaged OHC can be predicted from a combination of conductance and depth-averaged conductivity ocean fields to within nearly 0.1% (1%) error globally and even more accurately in many poorly observed (e.g., ice-covered) regions. Practical application of this statistical framework to monitor OHC requires examination of the effect of uncertainties in the observed bathymetry and ocean conductance, which vary with application.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zanna, Laure</author><author>Khatiwala, Samar</author><author>Gregory, Jonathan M</author><author>Ison, Jonathan</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global reconstruction of historical ocean heat storage and transport</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1126 LP - 1131</pages><volume>116</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1808838115</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zanna, L., Khatiwala, S., Gregory, J.

Before the 1990s, most ocean temperature measurements were above 700 m and therefore, insufficient for an accurate global estimate of ocean warming. We present a method to reconstruct ocean temperature changes with global, full-depth ocean coverage, revealing warming of 436 ×1021 J since 1871. Our reconstruction, which agrees with other estimates for the well-observed period, demonstrates that the ocean absorbed as much heat during 1921–1946 as during 1990–2015. Since the 1950s, up to one-half of excess heat in the Atlantic Ocean at midlatitudes has come from other regions via circulation-related changes in heat transport.Most of the excess energy stored in the climate system due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has been taken up by the oceans, leading to thermal expansion and sea-level rise. The oceans thus have an important role in the Earth’s energy imbalance. Observational constraints on future anthropogenic warming critically depend on accurate estimates of past ocean heat content (OHC) change. We present a reconstruction of OHC since 1871, with global coverage of the full ocean depth. Our estimates combine timeseries of observed sea surface temperatures with much longer historical coverage than those in the ocean interior together with a representation (a Green’s function) of time-independent ocean transport processes. For 1955–2017, our estimates are comparable with direct estimates made by infilling the available 3D time-dependent ocean temperature observations. We find that the global ocean absorbed heat during this period at a rate of 0.30 ± 0.06 W/m2 in the upper 2,000 m and 0.028 ± 0.026 W/m2 below 2,000 m, with large decadal fluctuations. The total OHC change since 1871 is estimated at 436 ± 91 ×1021 J, with an increase during 1921–1946 (145 ± 62 ×1021 J) that is as large as during 1990–2015. By comparing with direct estimates, we also infer that, during 1955–2017, up to one-half of the Atlantic Ocean warming and thermosteric sea-level rise at low latitudes to midlatitudes emerged due to heat convergence from changes in ocean transport.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, Yang</author><author>Bao, Xianwen</author><author>Yao, Zhigang</author><author>Bi, Congcong</author><author>Wan, Kai</author><author>Bao, Min</author><author>Jiang, Zhipeng</author><author>Song, Jun</author><author>Gao, Jia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observational and model studies of synoptic current fluctuations in the Bohai Strait on the Chinese continental shelf</title><secondary-title>Ocean Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Dynamics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10236-019-01247-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ding, Y., Bao, X., Yao, Z., Bi, C., Wan, K., Bao, M., … Gao, J.

The results indicate that subsurface processes were especially strong in the summer of 2014 and they led to positive sea surface salinity anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific. The positive sea surface salinity anomalies induced a westward displacement of the sea surface salinity front that represents the eastern boundary of the western Pacific warm pool, preventing the warm surface water from shifting eastward as seen in a typical El Niño event. In the meantime, more salty water was transported equatorward by a strengthening subtropical cell in the South Pacific. The enhanced subsurface processes in the central equatorial Pacific conveyed the salinity anomalies of subtropical origin to the sea surface and were largely responsible for the sea surface salinity variability but had less impacts on sea surface temperature during the 2014/15 failed El Niño, suggesting some potential advantage of ocean salinity in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation prediction.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nie, Xunwei</author><author>Gao, Shan</author><author>Wang, Fan</author><author>Chi, Jianwei</author><author>Qu, Tangdong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Origins and pathways of the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent identified by a simulated adjoint tracer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>0</volume><issue>ja</issue><keywords><keyword>Pacific Equatorical Undercurrent</keyword><keyword>cells</keyword><keyword>modeling</keyword><keyword>pathway</keyword><keyword>source water</keyword><keyword>transit time</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018JC014212</electronic-resource-num><notes>doi: 10.1029/2018JC014212</notes><research-notes>doi: 10.1029/2018JC014212</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014212</url></web-urls></urls><label>Adjoint</label><abstract>Abstract The origins and pathways of the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) are investigated using a simulated adjoint tracer of the consortium Estimating the Circulation &amp; Climate of the Ocean (ECCO). The main source waters of the EUC, as well as their transit time and contributions, are identified. The zonal variability of the EUC water composition and the contributions from different pathways are also estimated. Results show that the ratio of the EUC water coming from the tropics to that from extratropics is relatively stable (1 versus 4) along the equator, except in the western Pacific where extratropical water is more dominant. The main body of extratropical water within the EUC are transported through the western boundary pathways (WBPs), while the percent transported via the interior pathways (IPs) gradually increases toward the east. Tropical water merges into the EUC mainly through the Tropical Cells (TCs) with a larger portion through the northern side of the equator.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Ferreira, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global ocean heat transport dominated by heat export from the tropical Pacific</title><secondary-title>Nature Geoscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Geoscience</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><keywords><keyword>Climate and Earth system modelling</keyword><keyword>Physical oceanography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41561-019-0333-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Forget, Ferreira - 2019 - Global ocean heat transport dominated by heat export from the tropical Pacific.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0333-7</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Heat redistribution is one of the main mechanisms by which oceans regulate Earth’s climate. Analyses of ocean heat transport tend to emphasize global-scale seawater pathways and concepts such as the great ocean conveyor belt. However, it is the divergence or convergence of heat transport within an oceanic region, rather than the origin or destination of seawater transiting through that region, that is most immediately relevant to Earth’s heat budget. Here we use a recent gridded estimate of ocean heat transport to reveal the net effect on Earth’s heat budget, the ‘effective’ ocean heat transport, by removing internal ocean heat loops that have obscured the interpretation of measurements. The result demonstrates the overwhelming predominance of the tropical Pacific, which exports four times as much heat as is imported in the Atlantic and Arctic. It also highlights the unique ability of the Atlantic and Indian oceans to transport heat across the Equator—Northward and Southward, respectively. However, effective inter-ocean heat transports are smaller than expected, suggesting that global-scale seawater pathways play only a minor role in Earth’s heat budget.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wagner, Charlotte C.</author><author>Amos, Helen M.</author><author>Thackray, Colin P.</author><author>Zhang, Yanxu</author><author>Lundgren, Elizabeth W.</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Friedman, Carey L.</author><author>Selin, Noelle E.</author><author>Lohmann, Rainer</author><author>Sunderland, Elsie M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A global 3-D ocean model for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): Benchmark compounds for understanding the impacts of global change on neutral persistent organic pollutants</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>2018GB006018</pages><keywords><keyword>biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>fate and transport modeling</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>persistent pollutants</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018gb006018</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Wagner et al. - 2019 - A global 3-D ocean model for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) Benchmark compounds for understanding the impacts o.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GB006018</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Hill, Christopher N.</author><author>Ponte, Rui M.</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce</author><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Nguyen, An T.</author><author>Piecuch, Christopher</author><author>Trossman, David</author><author>Verdy, Ariane</author><author>Wang, Ou</author><author>Zhang, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Putting It All Together: Adding Value to the Global Ocean and Climate Observing Systems With Complete Self-Consistent Ocean State and Parameter Estimates</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Marine Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Marine Science</full-title></periodical><pages>55</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>Adjoint method</keyword><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation and climate</keyword><keyword>coupled Earth system data assimilation</keyword><keyword>global ocean inverse modeling</keyword><keyword>ocean observations</keyword><keyword>optimal state and parameter estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Frontiers</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fmars.2019.00055</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Heimbach et al. - 2019 - Putting It All Together Adding Value to the Global Ocean and Climate Observing Systems With Complete Self-Consi.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2019.00055/full</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In 1999, the consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) set out to synthesize the hydrographic data collected by the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and satellite sea surface height measurements into a complete and coherent description of the ocean afforded by an ocean general circulation model. Twenty years later, the versatility of ECCO's estimation framework enables production of global and regional ocean and sea-ice state estimates that incorporate not only the initial suite of data and its successors, but nearly all data streams available today. New observations include measurements from Argo floats, marine mammal-based hydrography, satellite retrievals of ocean bottom pressure and sea surface salinity, and ice-tethered profiler data in polar regions. The framework also produces improved estimates of uncertain inputs, including initial conditions, surface atmospheric state variables, and mixing parameters. The freely available state estimates and related efforts are property-conserving, allowing closed budget calculations that are a requisite to detect, quantify, and understand the evolution of climate-relevant signals as mandated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) protocol. The solutions can be reproduced by users through provision of the underlying modeling and assimilation machinery. Regional efforts have spun off that offer increased spatial resolution to better resolve relevant processes. Emerging foci of ECCO are on global sea level change, in particular contributions from polar ice sheets, and the increased use of biogeochemical and ecosystem data to constrain global cycles of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Challenges in the coming decade include provision of uncertainties, informing observing system design, globally increased resolution, and moving toward coupled Earth system estimation with consistent momentum, heat and freshwater fluxes between the ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere and land.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean acoustic tomography in the North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>183-202</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Acoustic measurements/effects</keyword><keyword>In situ oceanic observations</keyword><keyword>Ocean models</keyword><keyword>Optimization</keyword><keyword>Principal components analysis</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity studies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JTECH-D-18-0082.1</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>ECCO-V4</label></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Fan</author><author>Cornillon, Peter</author><author>Guan, Lei</author><author>Kilpatrick, Katherine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-Term Variations in the Pixel-to-Pixel Variability of NOAA AVHRR SST Fields from 1982 to 2015</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>844</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs11070844</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/7/844</url></web-urls></urls><label>LLC_hires</label><abstract>Sea surface temperature (SST) fields obtained from the series of space-borne five-channel Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs) provide the longest continuous time series of global SST available to date (1981–present). As a result, these data have been used for many studies and significant effort has been devoted to their careful calibration in an effort to provide a climate quality data record. However, little attention has been given to the local precision of the SST retrievals obtained from these instruments, which we refer to as the pixel-to-pixel (p2p) variability, a characteristic important in the ability to resolve structures such as ocean fronts characterized by small gradients in the SST field. In this study, the p2p variability is estimated for Level-2 SST fields obtained with the Pathfinder retrieval algorithm for AVHRRs on NOAA-07, 9, 11, 12 and 14-19. These estimates are stratified by year, season, day/night and along-scan/along-track. The overall variability ranges from 0.10 K to 0.21 K. For each satellite, the along-scan variability is between 10 and 20% smaller than the along-track variability (except for NOAA-16 nighttime for which it is approximately 30% smaller) and the summer and fall σ s are between 10 and 15% smaller than the winter and spring σ s. The differences between along-track and along-scan are attributed to the way in which the instrument has been calibrated. The seasonal differences result from the T 4 − T 5 term in the Pathfinder retrieval algorithm. This term is shown to be a major contributor to the p2p variability and it is shown that its impact could be substantially reduced without a deleterious effect on the overall p2p σ of the resulting products by spatially averaging it as part of the retrieval process. The AVHRR/3s (NOAA-15 through 19) were found to be relatively stable with trends in the p2p variability of at most 0.015 K/decade.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl"

the outlet for many Canadian rivers, receiving roughly 900 km3/year of river runoff. Historically, studies found a consistent cyclonic flow year‐round in Hudson Bay, due to the geostrophic boundary current induced by river discharge and cyclonic wind forcing that was supported by available observations at that time. Using a high resolution ocean general circulation model, we show that, in summer, the mean circulation is not cyclonic, but consists of multiple small cyclonic and anticyclonic features, with the mean flow directed through the center of the bay. Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) and velocity observations also show this seasonal flow pattern. We find that this summer circulation is driven by geostrophic currents, generated by steric height gradients which are induced by increased river discharge during the spring freshet, and reinforced by anticyclonic seasonal wind patterns.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mikolaj, M.</author><author>Reich, M.</author><author>Güntner, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resolving Geophysical Signals by Terrestrial Gravimetry: A Time Domain Assessment of the Correction-Induced Uncertainty</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Earth tides</keyword><keyword>atmosphere</keyword><keyword>gravity observations</keyword><keyword>hydrology</keyword><keyword>nontidal ocean loading</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018JB016682</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JB016682%0A</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECCO-KFS;ECCO2</label><abstract>Terrestrial gravimetry is increasingly used to monitor mass transport processes in geophysics boosted by the ongoing technological development of instruments. Resolving a particular phenomenon of interest, however, requires a set of gravity corrections of which the uncertainties have not been addressed up to now. In this study, we quantify the time domain uncertainty of tide, global atmospheric, large‐scale hydrological, and non‐tidal ocean loading corrections. The uncertainty is assessed by comparing the majority of available global models for a suite of sites worldwide . The average uncertainty expressed as root‐mean‐square error equals 5.1 nm/s2, discounting local hydrology or air pressure. The correction‐induced uncertainty of gravity changes over various time periods of interest ranges from 0.6 nm/s2 for hours up to a maximum of 6.7 nm/s2 for six months. The corrections are shown to be significant and should be applied for most geophysical applications of terrestrial gravimetry. From a statistical point of view however, resolving subtle gravity effects in the order of few nm/s2 is challenged by the uncertainty of the corrections. Many scientist are exploring ways to benefit from gravity measurements in fields of high societal relevance such as monitoring of volcanoes or measuring the amount of water in underground. Any application of such new methods, however, requires careful preparation of the gravity measurements. The intention of the preparation process is to ensure that the measurements do not contain information about processes which are not of interest. For that reason, the influence of atmosphere, ocean, tides and hydrology needs to be reduced from the gravity. In this study, we investigate how this reduction process influences the quality of the measurement. We found that the precision degrades especially owing to the hydrology. The ocean plays an important role at sites close to the coast and the atmosphere at sites located in mountains. The overall errors of the reductions may complicate a reliable use of gravity measurements in certain studies focusing on very small signals. Nevertheless, the precision of gravity reductions alone does not obstruct a meaningful use of gravity measurements in most research fields. Details specifying the reduction precision are provided in this study allowing scientist dealing with gravity measurements to decide if their signal of interest can be reliably resolved.

Its strength is directly related to the halocline depth, and therefore also to the storage of freshwater. It has recently been proposed that the equilibrium state of the BG is set by the Ice‐Ocean Governor, a negative feedback between surface currents and ice‐ocean stress, rather than a balance between lateral mesoscale eddy fluxes and surface Ekman pumping. However, mesoscale eddies are present in the Arctic Ocean; it is therefore important to extend the Ice‐Ocean Governor theory to include lateral fluxes due to mesoscale eddies. Here, a non‐linear ordinary differential equation is derived that represents the effects of wind stress, the Ice‐Ocean Governor, and eddy fluxes. Equilibrium and time‐varying solutions to this three‐way balance equation are obtained and shown to closely match the output from a hierarchy of numerical simulations, indicating that the analytical model represents the processes controlling BG equilibration. The equilibration timescale derived from this three‐way balance is faster than the eddy equilibration timescale and slower than the Ice‐Ocean Governor equilibration timescales for most values of eddy diffusivity. The sensitivity of the BG equilibrium depth to changes in eddy diffusivity and the presence of the Ice‐Ocean Governor is also explored. These results show that predicting the response of the BG to changing surface forcing and sea ice conditions requires faithfully capturing the three‐way balance between the Ice‐Ocean Governor, wind stress, and eddy fluxes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wei, Jianfen</author><author>Zhang, Xiangdong</author><author>Wang, Zhaomin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reexamination of Fram Strait sea ice export and its role in recently accelerated Arctic sea ice retreat</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Fram Strait</keyword><keyword>MITgcm-ECCO2</keyword><keyword>Regime shift</keyword><keyword>Sea ice export</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-019-04741-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04741-0%0A</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECCO2</label></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>WANG, Zhaomin</author><author>CHEN, Dake</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polar climate system modeling in China: Recent progress and future challenges</title><secondary-title>Science China Earth Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science China Earth Sciences</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-018-9355-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-018-9355-2%0A</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECCO2</label></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Qinghua</author><author>Mu, Longjiang</author><author>Xingren Wue, Jiping Liuf, Fei Zhengg, Jinlun Zhangh, Chuanjin Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving Arctic sea ice seasonal outlook by ensemble prediction using an ice-ocean model</title><secondary-title>Atmospheric Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Atmospheric Research</full-title></periodical><volume>227</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.04.021</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.04.021%0A</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECCO2</label></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jyoti, J.</author><author>Swapna, · P.</author><author>Krishnan, · R.</author><author>Naidu, · C.

Examination of global ocean and sea ice reanalysis data in years 2008–2015 suggests trajectories of these mesoscale eddies over the Kuroshio zone can be categorized into three different patterns: ~63% of mesoscale eddies dissipating during the eddy-current interaction, ~33% moving to the north along the Kuroshio and only ~4% passing through the Kuroshio and Luzon Strait (LS) to enter to the South China Sea (SCS). A three-dimensional ocean circulation model based on the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm) is used to study the evolution of a westward propagating mesoscale eddy during the eddy-current interaction. Thirteen numerical experiments are conducted with the circulation model driven by currents specified at the southern and northern open boundaries to represent the influence of the Kuroshio. A mesoscale eddy is initialized to the east of the Kuroshio and the model is integrated for 70 days in each experiment. Model results suggest that the northward-flowing Kuroshio Current and the seamount topography within LS form a barrier for the westward propagating eddies to enter the South China Sea (SCS). Non-linear interactions between the Kuroshio Current, local topography and westward propagating mesoscale eddies can generate localized eddies in LS which could be shed into the SCS. Furthermore, the eddy-current interaction is found to be one of mechanisms for generating a multi-eddy structure in LS region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Y.</author><author>Guan, Y.

Leads and pressure ridges are dominant features of the Arctic sea ice cover. Not only do they affect heat loss and surface drag, but also provide insight into the underlying physics of sea ice deformation. Due to their elongated shape they are referred as Linear Kinematic Features (LKFs). This paper introduces two methods that detect and track LKFs in sea ice deformation data and establish an LKF data set for the entire observing period of the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS). Both algorithms are available as open-source code and applicable to any gridded sea-ice drift and deformation data. The LKF detection algorithm classifies pixels with higher deformation rates compared to the immediate environment as LKF pixels, divides the binary LKF map into small segments, and re-connects multiple segments into individual LKFs based their distance and orientation relative to each other. The tracking algorithm uses sea-ice drift information to estimate a first guess of LKF distribution and identifies tracked features by the degree of overlap between detected features and the first guess. An optimization of the parameters of both algorithms is presented, as well as an extensive evaluation of both algorithms against hand-picked features in a reference data set. An LKF data set is derived from RGPS deformation data for the years from 1996 to 2008 that enables a comprehensive description of LKFs. LKF densities and LKF intersection angles derived from this data set agree well with previous estimates. Further, a power-law distribution of LKF length, an exponential distribution of LKF lifetimes, and a strong link to atmospheric drivers, here Arctic cyclones, is derived from the data set. Both algorithms are applied to output of a numerical sea-ice model to compare the LKF intersection angles in a high-resolution Arctic sea-ice simulation with the LKF data set.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Yi</author><author>Lemaitre, Nolwenn</author><author>Castrillejo, Maxi</author><author>Roca-Martí, Montserrat</author><author>Masqué, Pere</author><author>Stewart, Gillian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The export flux of particulate organic carbon derived from 210 Po/ 210 Pb disequilibria along the North Atlantic GEOTRACES GA01 transect: GEOVIDE cruise</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-16-309-2019</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-309-2019%0A</url></web-urls></urls><label>ECCO2</label><abstract>Abstract. The disequilibrium between 210Po activity and 210Pb activity in seawater samples was determined along the GEOTRACES GA01 transect in the North Atlantic during the GEOVIDE cruise (May–June 2014). A steady-state model was used to quantify vertical export of particulate 210Po. Vertical advection was incorporated into one version of the model using time-averaged vertical velocity, which had substantial variance. This resulted in large uncertainties for the 210Po export flux in this model, suggesting that those calculations of 210Po export fluxes should be used with great care. Despite the large uncertainties, there is no question that the deficits of 210Po in the Iberian Basin and at the Greenland Shelf have been strongly affected by vertical advection. Using the export flux of 210Po and the particulate organic carbon (POC) to 210Po ratio of total (&gt;1µm) particles, we determined the POC export fluxes along the transect. Both the magnitude and efficiency of the estimated POC export flux from the surface ocean varied spatially within our study region. Export fluxes of POC ranged from negligible to 10mmolCm−2d−1, with enhanced POC export in the Labrador Sea. The cruise track was characterized by overall low POC export relative to net primary production (export efficiency &lt;1%–15%), but relatively high export efficiencies were seen in the basins where diatoms dominated the phytoplankton community. The particularly low export efficiencies in the Iberian Basin, on the other hand, were explained by the dominance of smaller phytoplankton, such as cyanobacteria or coccolithophores. POC fluxes estimated from the 210Po∕210Pb and 234Th∕238U disequilibria agreed within a factor of 3 along the transect, with higher POC estimates generally derived from 234Th. The differences were attributed to integration timescales and the history of bloom events.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My

The Argentine-German Geodetic Observatory (AGGO) is one of the very few sites in the southern hemisphere equipped with a comprehensive cutting-edge geodetic instrumentation. The employed observation techniques are used for a wide range of geophysical applications. The presented multi-compartmental data set provides gravity time series and selected gravity models together with the hydrometeorological monitoring data of the observatory. These parameters are of great interest to the scientific community, e.g., for achieving accurate realization of terrestrial and celestial reference frames. Moreover, the availability of the hydrometeorological products is beneficial to inhabitants of the region as they allow for monitoring of environmental changes and natural hazards including extreme events. The hydrological data set is composed of time series of groundwater level, modelled and observed soil moisture content, soil temperature, and physical soil properties and aquifer properties. The meteorological time series include air temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, solar radiation, precipitation, and derived reference evapotranspiration. These data products are extended by gravity models of hydrological, oceanic, La Plata Estuary, and atmospheric effects. The quality of the provided meteorological time series is tested via comparison to the two closest WMO sites where data is available only in an inferior temporal resolution. The hydrological series are validated by comparing the respective forward-modelled gravity effects to independent gravity observations reduced up to a signal corresponding to local water storage variation. Most of the time series cover the time span between April 2016 and November 2018 with either no, or only few missing data points. The data set is available at https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.5.4.2018.001 (Mikolaj et al., 2018).</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My

responses of plankton to variations in essential nutrients is hampered by limited in situ measurements, a poor understanding of community composition, and the lack of reference gene catalogs for key taxa. Iron is a key driver of plankton dynamics and, therefore, of global biogeochemical cycles and climate. To assess the impact of iron availability on plankton communities, we explored the comprehensive bio‐oceanographic and bio‐omics data sets from Tara Oceans in the context of the iron products from two state‐of‐the‐art global scale biogeochemical models. We obtained novel information about adaptation and acclimation toward iron in a range of phytoplankton, including picocyanobacteria and diatoms, and identified whole subcommunities covarying with iron. Many of the observed global patterns were recapitulated in the Marquesas archipelago, where frequent plankton blooms are believed to be caused by natural iron fertilization, although they are not captured in large‐scale biogeochemical models. This work provides a proof of concept that integrative analyses, spanning from genes to ecosystems and viruses to zooplankton, can disentangle the complexity of plankton communities and can lead to more accurate formulations of resource bioavailability in biogeochemical models, thus improving our understanding of plankton resilience in a changing environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Guancheng</author><author>Zhang, Yuhong</author><author>Xiao, Jingen</author><author>Song, Xiangzhou</author><author>Abraham, John</author><author>Cheng, Lijing</author><author>Zhu, Jiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Examining the salinity change in the upper Pacific Ocean during the Argo period</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>6055-6074</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-019-04912-z</electronic-resource-num><notes>Li, G., Zhang, Y., Xiao, J., Song, X., Abraham, J., Cheng, L., &amp;amp; Zhu, J.

Using Argo-based observations and the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), a salinity budget analysis in the upper 200 m was conducted to investigate what controls the recent observed salinity change in the Pacific Ocean. The results showed that the increasing salinity since 2005 was mainly caused by a reduction of surface precipitation. The ocean advection dampened the surface freshwater anomalies and rebuilt regional salinity balance. Both precipitation and advection are closely associated with the sea surface wind anomalies, suggesting the wind-driven changes in the ocean salinity field. A further analysis using an ocean objective analysis product and model simulations in addition to ECCO suggests that the recent salinity pattern since 2005 are related to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). This study also highlights the strong regulation of the ocean salinity change by natural decadal variability in the climate system.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carton, James A</author><author>Penny, Stephen G</author><author>Kalnay, Eugenia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temperature and Salinity Variability in the SODA3, ECCO4r3, and ORAS5 Ocean Reanalyses, 1993–2015</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>2277-2293</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0605.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Carton, J.

The three reanalyses share similar historical hydrographic data, but the forcings, forward models, estimation algorithms, and bias correction methods are different. The study begins by comparing the reanalyses to independent analyses of historical SST, heat, and salt content, as well as examining the analysis-minus-observation misfits. While the misfits are generally small, they still reveal some systematic biases that are not present in the reference Hadley Center EN4 objective analysis. We next explore global trends in temperature averaged into three depth intervals: 0?300, 300?1000, and 1000?2000 m. We find considerable similarity in the spatial structure of the trends and their distribution among different ocean basins; however, the trends in global averages do differ by 30%?40%, which implies an equivalent level of disagreement in net surface heating rates. ECCO4r3 is distinct in having quite weak warming trends while ORAS5 has stronger trends that are noticeable in the deeper layers. To examine the performance of the reanalyses in the Arctic we explore representation of Atlantic Water variability on the Atlantic side of the Arctic and upper-halocline freshwater storage on the Pacific side of the Arctic. These comparisons are encouraging for the application of ocean reanalyses to track ocean climate variability and change at high northern latitudes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Chao</author><author>Liang, Xinfeng</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Vinogradova, Nadya</author><author>Wang, Ou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vertical redistribution of salt and layered changes in global ocean salinity</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>3445</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41467-019-11436-x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liu, C., Liang, X., Ponte, R.

Due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of the existing salinity measurements, previous studies of global salinity changes focused mostly on the surface and upper oceans. Here, we examine global ocean salinity changes and ocean vertical salt fluxes over the full depth in a dynamically consistent and data-constrained ocean state estimate. The changes of the horizontally averaged salinity display a vertically layered structure, consistent with the profiles of the ocean vertical salt fluxes. For salinity changes in the relatively well-observed upper ocean, the contribution of vertical exchange of salt can be on the same order of the net surface freshwater input. The vertical redistribution of salt thus should be considered in inferring changes in global ocean salinity and the hydrological cycle from the surface and upper ocean measurements.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Thompson, Philip R</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Merrifield, Mark A</author><author>Hamlington, Benjamin D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What Caused Recent Shifts in Tropical Pacific Decadal Sea-Level Trends?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>7575-7590</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>decadal variability</keyword><keyword>sea-level change</keyword><keyword>sea-level variability</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword><keyword>tropical Pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2019JC015339</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

An ocean state estimate that faithfully reproduces the observations is used to elucidate the origin of these low-frequency tropical Pacific ? variations. Analysis of the hydrostatic equation reveals that recent decadal ? changes in the tropical Pacific are mainly thermosteric in nature, related to changes in upper-ocean heat content. A forcing experiment performed with the numerical model suggests that anomalous wind stress was an important driver of the relevant heat storage and thermosteric variation. Closed budget diagnostics further clarify that the wind-stress-related thermosteric ? variation resulted from the joint actions of large-scale ocean advection and local surface heat flux, such that advection controlled the budget over shorter, intraseasonal to interannual time scales, and local surface heat flux became increasingly influential at longer decadal periods. In particular, local surface heat flux was important in contributing to a recent reversal of decadal ? trends in the tropical Pacific. Contributions from local surface heat flux partly reflect damping latent heat flux tied to wind-stress-driven sea-surface-temperature variations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amin, Hadi</author><author>Sjöberg, Lars E.</author><author>Bagherbandi, Mohammad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A global vertical datum defined by the conventional geoid potential and the Earth ellipsoid parameters</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodesy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodesy</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Geodetic reference system</keyword><keyword>Geoid potential W0</keyword><keyword>Global vertical datum</keyword><keyword>Mean Earth ellipsoid</keyword><keyword>Reference ellipsoid</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00190-019-01293-3</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The geoid, according to the classical Gauss–Listing definition, is, among infinite equipotential surfaces of the Earth’s gravity field, the equipotential surface that in a least squares sense best fits the undisturbed mean sea level. This equipotential surface, except for its zero-degree harmonic, can be characterized using the Earth’s global gravity models (GGM). Although, nowadays, satellite altimetry technique provides the absolute geoid height over oceans that can be used to calibrate the unknown zero-degree harmonic of the gravimetric geoid models, this technique cannot be utilized to estimate the geometric parameters of the mean Earth ellipsoid (MEE). The main objective of this study is to perform a joint estimation of W0, which defines the zero datum of vertical coordinates, and the MEE parameters relying on a new approach and on the newest gravity field, mean sea surface and mean dynamic topography models. As our approach utilizes both satellite altimetry observations and a GGM model, we consider different aspects of the input data to evaluate the sensitivity of our estimations to the input data. Unlike previous studies, our results show that it is not sufficient to use only the satellite-component of a quasi-stationary GGM to estimate W0. In addition, our results confirm a high sensitivity of the applied approach to the altimetry-based geoid heights, i.e., mean sea surface and mean dynamic topography models. Moreover, as W0 should be considered a quasi-stationary parameter, we quantify the effect of time-dependent Earth’s gravity field changes as well as the time-dependent sea level changes on the estimation of W0. Our computations resulted in the geoid potential W0 = 62636848.102 ± 0.004 m2 s−2 and the semi-major and minor axes of the MEE, a = 6378137.678 ± 0.0003 m and b = 6356752.964 ± 0.0005 m, which are 0.678 and 0.650 m larger than those axes of GRS80 reference ellipsoid, respectively. Moreover, a new estimation for the geocentric gravitational constant was obtained as GM = (398600460.55 ± 0.03) × 106 m3 s−2.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jordan, James R</author><author>Holland, Paul R</author><author>Goldberg, Dan</author><author>Snow, Kate</author><author>Arthern, Robert</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Jenkins, Adrian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean-Forced Ice-Shelf Thinning in a Synchronously Coupled Ice-Ocean Model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>2219-2293</pages><volume>125</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC013251</electronic-resource-num><notes>Jordan, J.

Unlike previous, asynchronous, approaches to coupled modeling our approach is fully conservative of heat, salt, and mass. Synchronous coupling is achieved by continuously updating the ice-shelf thickness on the ocean time step. By simulating an idealized, warm-water ice shelf we show how raising the pycnocline leads to a reduction in both ice-shelf mass and back stress, and hence buttressing. Coupled runs show the formation of a western boundary channel in the ice-shelf base due to increased melting on the western boundary due to Coriolis enhanced flow. Eastern boundary ice thickening is also observed. This is not the case when using a simple depth-dependent parameterized melt, as the ice shelf has relatively thinner sides and a thicker central ‘‘bulge’’ for a given ice-shelf mass. Ice-shelf geometry arising from the parameterized melt rate tends to underestimate backstress (and therefore buttressing) for a given ice-shelf mass due to a thinner ice shelf at the boundaries when compared to coupled model simulations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wood, M</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Millan, R</author><author>Morlighem, M</author><author>Mouginot, J</author><author>Seroussi, Hélène</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean-Induced Melt Triggers Glacier Retreat in Northwest Greenland</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Greenland ice sheet</keyword><keyword>glacier retreat</keyword><keyword>ice front undercutting</keyword><keyword>ice fronts</keyword><keyword>ice-ocean interactions</keyword><keyword>ocean warming</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018GL078024</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wood, M., Rignot, E., Fenty, I., Menemenlis, D., Millan, R., Morlighem, M., … Seroussi, H.

Here, we use novel observations of bathymetry and water temperature from NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland mission to quantify the role of warm, salty Atlantic Water in controlling the evolution of 37 glaciers. Modeled ocean-induced undercutting of calving margins compared with ice advection and ice-front retreat observed by satellites from 1985 to 2015 indicate that 35 glaciers retreated when cumulative anomalies in ocean-induced undercutting rose above the range of seasonal variability of calving-front positions, while 2 glaciers standing on shallow sills and colder water did not retreat. Deviations in the observed timing of retreat are explained by residual uncertainties in bathymetry, inefficient mixing of waters in shallow fjords, and the presence of small floating sections. Overall, warmer ocean temperature triggered the retreat, but calving processes dominate ablation (71%).</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Ying</author><author>Feng, Ming</author><author>Du, Yan</author><author>Phillips, Helen E</author><author>Bindoff, Nathaniel L</author><author>McPhaden, Michael J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Strengthened Indonesian Throughflow Drives Decadal Warming in the Southern Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>6167-6175</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Ekman transport</keyword><keyword>Indonesian Throughflow</keyword><keyword>air-sea flux</keyword><keyword>heat budget</keyword><keyword>ocean boundary current</keyword><keyword>upper ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018GL078265</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhang, Y., Feng, M., Du, Y., Phillips, H.

The largest spatial gradients in ζ trends, predicted from solving the sea level equation using GRACE retrievals of mass distribution over land for the period 2005–15, occur near Greenland and West Antarctica, consistent with a strong local land ice loss. Misinterpreting the estimated static GAL trends in ζ as dynamic pressure gradients can lead to substantial errors in large-scale geostrophic transports across the Southern Ocean and the subpolar North Atlantic over the analyzed decade. South of Greenland, where altimeter sea level and hydrography (Argo) data coverage is good, the residual ζ minus steric height trends are similar in magnitude and sign to the gravitationally based predictions. In addition, estimated GAL-related trends are as large—if not larger than—other factors, such as deep steric height, dynamic bottom pressure, and glacial isostatic rebound. Thus, accounting for static GAL effects on ζ records, which are commonly neglected in oceanographic studies, seems important for a quantitative interpretation of the observed ζ trends.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Piecuch, C G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms Controlling Global Mean Sea Surface Temperature Determined From a State Estimate</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>3221-3227</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>sea surface temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017GL076821</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

The temporal evolution of can be influenced by surface heat fluxes ( ) and by diffusion ( ) and advection ( ) processes internal to the ocean, but quantifying the contribution of these different factors from data alone is prone to substantial uncertainties. Here we derive a closed budget for the period 1993–2015 based on a global ocean state estimate, which is an exact solution of a general circulation model constrained to most extant ocean observations through advanced optimization methods. The estimated average temperature of the top (10-m thick) level in the model, taken to represent , shows relatively small variability at most time scales compared to , , or , reflecting the tendency for largely balancing effects from all the latter terms.

The estimate was produced from a least squares fit of a free-running ocean general circulation model to almost all available near-global data. Data coverage in space and time during this period is far more homogeneous than in any earlier interval and includes CTD, elephant seal, and Argo temperature and salinity profiles; sea ice coverage; full altimetric and gravity-field coverage; satellite sea surface temperatures; and the initializing meteorological coverage from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim). Dominant remaining data inhomogeneity arises from increasing coverage from the Argo profiles from about 2000 to the present. The state estimate exactly satisfies the primitive equations of the free-running Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm) at all times and hence produces values satisfying the fundamental conservation laws of energy, freshwater, and so forth, permitting its use for climate change studies. Quantities such as calculated heat content depend upon all observations, not just temperature, for example, altimetric height and meteorological exchanges. Output files are publicly available in Network Common Data Form (netCDF) and MATLAB form and include hydrographic variables, three components of velocity, and pressure at all depths, as well as other variables, including inferred air?sea momentum and buoyancy fluxes, 3D mixing parameters, and sea ice cover.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards determining uncertainties in global oceanic mean values of heat, salt, and surface elevation</title><secondary-title>Tellus A: Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tellus A: Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/16000870.2018.1471911</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2018: Towards determining uncertainties in global oceanic mean values of heat, salt, and surface elevation.

The essential step of separating stochastic from systematic or deterministic elements of the fields is explored by suppressing the globally correlated components of the fields. Justification lies in the physics and the brevity of a 20-year estimate relative to the full oceanic adjustment time, and the inferred near-linearity of response on short time intervals. Lower-bound uncertainties reflecting the only stochastic elements of the state estimate are then calculated from bootstrap estimates. Trends are estimated as 2:2 6 0:2 mm=y in elevation, 0.0011 ± 0.0001 C/y, and ( 2.825 ± 0.17) 10 5 for surface elevation, temperature and salt, with formal 2-standard deviation uncertainties. The temperature change corresponds to a 20-year average ocean heating rate of 0:4860:1 W/m2 of which 0.1 W/m2 arises from the geothermal forcing. Systematic errors must be determined separately.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jinbo</author><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Thomas Farrar, J</author><author>Chao, Yi</author><author>Thompson, Andrew F</author><author>Flexas, Mar M</author><author>Fu, Lee Lueng</author><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Thomas Farrar, J</author><author>Chao, Yi</author><author>Thompson, Andrew F</author><author>Flexas, Mar M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An observing system simulation experiment for the calibration and validation of the Surface Water Ocean Topography Sea surface height measurement using in situ platforms</title><secondary-title>J.

While the SSH wavenumber spectrum has been well studied at mesoscale wavelengths and longer, using both in situ oceanographic measurements and satellite altimetry, it remains largely unknown for wavelengths less than $~$70 km. The Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission aims to resolve the SSH wavenumber spectrum at 15–150-km wavelengths, which is specified as one of the mission requirements. The mission calibration and validation (CalVal) requires the ground truth of a synoptic SSH field to resolve the targeted wavelengths, but no existing observational network is able to fulfill the task. A high-resolution global ocean simulation is used to conduct an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) to identify the suitable oceanographic in situ measurements for SWOT SSH CalVal.

This unique transport property is not captured in climate models that have insufficient resolution to simulate these submesoscale dynamics. Here, we use an ocean model with an unprecedented resolution that, for the first time, globally resolves sub-mesoscale heat transport. Upper-ocean submesoscale turbulence produces a systematically-upward heat transport that is five times larger than mesoscale heat transport, with winter-time averages up to 100 W/m 2 for mid-latitudes. Compared to a lower-resolution model, submesoscale heat transport warms the sea surface up to 0.3 °C and produces an upward annual-mean air–sea heat flux anomaly of 4–10 W/m 2 at mid-latitudes. These results indicate that submesoscale dynamics are critical to the transport of heat between the ocean interior and the atmosphere, and are thus a key component of the Earth's climate.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nakayama, Yoshihiro</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Zhang, Hong</author><author>Schodlok, Michael</author><author>Rignot, Eric</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Origin of Circumpolar Deep Water intruding onto the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea continental shelves</title><secondary-title>Nat.

Despite existing studies of cross-shelf and on-shelf CDW transports, CDW pathways onto the ABS originating from further offshore have never been investigated. Here, we investigate CDW pathways onto the ABS using a regional ocean model. Simulated CDW tracers from a zonal section across 67°S (S04P) circulate along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Ross Gyre (RG) and travel into ABS continental shelf after 3-5 years, but source locations are shifted westward by $~$900 km along S04P in 2001-2006 compared to 2009-2014. We find that simulated on-and off-shelf CDW is $~$0.1-0.2 °C warmer in the 2009-2014 case than in the 2001-2006 case together with changes in simulated ocean circulation. These differences are primarily caused by lateral, rather than surface, boundary conditions, implying that large-scale atmospheric and ocean circulations are able to control CDW pathways and thus off-and on-shelf CDW properties.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Torres, Hector S</author><author>Klein, Patrice</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Su, Zhan</author><author>Wang, Jinbo</author><author>Chen, Shuiming</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Partitioning ocean motions into balanced motions and internal gravity waves: A modeling study in anticipation of future space missions</title><secondary-title>J.

They have, however, different impacts on the ocean energy budget, which explains the need to partition motions into BMs and IGWs. One way is to exploit the synergy of using different satellite observations, the only observations with global coverage, and a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution. But we need first to characterize and understand their signatures on the different surface oceanic fields. This study addresses this issue by using an ocean global numerical simulation with high‐resolution (1/48°). Our methodology is based on the analysis of the 12,000 frequency‐wave number spectra to discriminate these two classes of motions in the surface kinetic energy, sea surface height, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, relative vorticity, and divergence fields and for two seasons. Results reveal a complex picture worldwide of the partition of motions between IGWs and BMs in the different surface fields, depending on the season, the hemisphere, and low and high eddy kinetic energy regions. But they also highlight some generic properties on the impact of these two classes of motions on the different fields. This points to the synergy of using present and future satellite observations to assess the ocean kinetic energy on a global scale. The 12,000 frequency‐wave number spectra represent a World Ocean Atlas of the surface ocean dynamics not fully exploited in the present study. We hope the use of this World Ocean Atlas by other studies will lead to extend much these results.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arbic, Brian K</author><author>Alford, Matthew H</author><author>Ansong, Joseph K</author><author>Buijsman, Maarten C</author><author>Ciotti, Robert B</author><author>Farrar, J Thomas</author><author>Hallberg, Robert W</author><author>Henze, Christopher E</author><author>Hill, Christopher N</author><author>Luecke, Conrad A</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Metzger, E Joseph</author><author>Müller, Malte</author><author>Nelson, Arin D</author><author>Nelson, Bron C</author><author>Ngodock, Hans E</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Richman, James G</author><author>Savage, Anna C</author><author>Scott, Robert B</author><author>Shriver, Jay F</author><author>Simmons, Harper L</author><author>Souopgui, Innocent</author><author>Timko, Patrick G</author><author>Wallcraft, Allan J</author><author>Zamudio, Luis</author><author>Zhao, Zhongxiang</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Chassignet, Eric P</author><author>Pascual, A</author><author>Tintoré, J</author><author>Verron, J</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>A Primer on Global Internal Tide and Internal Gravity Wave Continuum Modeling in HYCOM and MITgcm</title><secondary-title>New Front.

The use of incidence angles at 6 and 12 degrees allows a measurement of the directional wave spectrum which yields accurate corrections of the wave-induced bias in the current measurements. The instrument principle, algorithm for current velocity and mission performance are presented here. The proposed instrument can reveal features on tropical ocean and marginal ice zone dynamics that are inaccessible to other measurement systems, as well as a global monitoring of the ocean mesoscale that surpasses the capability of today's nadir altimeters.

A previously-developed scheme to allow continuous vertical movement of the ice-ocean interface of a floating ice shelf (“vertical coupling”) is built upon to allow continuous movement of the grounding line, or point of floa- tation of the ice sheet (“horizontal coupling”). Horizontal coupling is implemented through the maintenance of a thin layer of ocean ( ∼ 1 m) under grounded ice, which is inflated into the real ocean as the ice ungrounds. This is accomplished through a modification of the ocean model’s nonlinear free surface evolution in a manner akin to a hydrological model in the presence of steep bathymetry. The coupled model is applied to a number of idealized geometries and shown to successfully represent ocean-forced marine ice sheet retreat while maintaining a continuous ocean circulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sonnewald, Maike</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linear Predictability: A Sea Surface Height Case Study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>2599-2611</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0142.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sonnewald, M., C.

Twenty years of the Estimating the Circulation and Cli- mate of the Ocean (ECCOv4) state estimate (1992–2011) are used, fitting autoregressive moving average [ARMA(n, m)] models where the order of the coefficients is chosen by the Akaike information criteria (AIC). Up to 50% of the ocean SSH variability is dominated by the seasonal signal. The variance accounted for by the nonseasonal SSH is particularly distinct in the Southern and Pacific Oceans, containing .95% of the total SSH variance, and the expected prediction error growth takes a few months to reach a threshold of 1 cm. Isolated regions take 12 months or more to cross an accuracy threshold of 1 cm. Including the trend significantly increases the time taken to reach the threshold, particularly in the South Pacific. Annual averaging has expected pre- diction error growth of a few years to reach a threshold of 1 cm. Including the trend mainly increases the time taken to reach the threshold, but the time series is short and noisy.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferreira, David</author><author>Cessi, Paola</author><author>Coxall, Helen K</author><author>de Boer, Agatha</author><author>Dijkstra, Henk A</author><author>Drijfhout, Sybren S</author><author>Eldevik, Tor</author><author>Harnik, Nili</author><author>McManus, Jerry F</author><author>Marshall, David P</author><author>Nilsson, Johan</author><author>Roquet, Fabien</author><author>Schneider, Tapio</author><author>Wills, Robert C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atlantic-Pacific Asymmetry in Deep Water Formation</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>327-352</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-earth-082517-010045</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ferreira, D., and Coauthors, 2018: Atlantic-Pacific Asymmetry in Deep Water Formation.

This asymmetric global overturning pattern has persisted for the past 2–3 million years, with evidence for different ventilation modes in the deeper past. In the current climate, the Atlantic-Pacific asymmetry occurs because the Atlantic is more saline, enabling deep convection. To what extent the salinity contrast between the two basins is dominated by atmospheric processes (larger net evaporation over the Atlantic) or oceanic processes (salinity transport into the Atlantic) remains an outstanding question. Numerical simulations have provided support for both mechanisms; observations of the present climate support a strong role for atmospheric processes as well as some modulation by oceanic processes. A major avenue for future work is the quantification of the various processes at play to identify which mechanisms are primary in different climate states.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khatiwala, Samar</author><author>Graven, Heather</author><author>Payne, Sarah</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes to the Air-Sea Flux and Distribution of Radiocarbon in the Ocean Over the 21st Century</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>5617-5626</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018GL078172</electronic-resource-num><notes>Khatiwala, S., H.

Strong decreases in atmospheric Δ14C in the high-emission scenario result in strong outgassing of 14C over 2050–2100, causing Δ14C spatial gradients in the surface ocean and vertical gradients between the surface and intermediate waters to reverse sign. Surface Δ14C in the subtropical gyres is lower than Δ14C in Pacific Deep Water and Southern Ocean surface water in 2100. In the low-emission scenario, ocean Δ14C remains slightly higher than in 1950 and relatively constant over 2050–2100. Over the next 20 years we find decadal changes in Δ14C of −30‰ to +5‰ in the upper 2 km of the ocean, which should be detectable with continued hydrographic surveys. Our simulations can help in planning future observations, and they provide a baseline for investigating natural or anthropogenic changes in ocean circulation using ocean Δ14C observations and models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hutter, Nils</author><author>Losch, Martin</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scaling Properties of Arctic Sea Ice Deformation in a High-Resolution Viscous-Plastic Sea Ice Model and in Satellite Observations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>672-687</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>high-resolution modeling</keyword><keyword>scaling</keyword><keyword>sea ice deformation</keyword><keyword>sea ice rheology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC013119</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hutter, N., Losch, M., &amp;amp; Menemenlis, D.

In a 1 km pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean simulation, the small-scale sea ice deformations are evaluated with a scaling analysis in relation to satellite observations of the Envisat Geophysical Processor System (EGPS) in the Central Arctic. A new coupled scaling analysis for data on Eulerian grids is used to determine the spatial and temporal scaling and the coupling between temporal and spatial scales. The spatial scaling of the modeled sea ice deformation implies multifractality. It is also coupled to temporal scales and varies realistically by region and season. The agreement of the spatial scaling with satellite observations challenges previous results with VP models at coarser resolution, which did not reproduce the observed scaling. The temporal scaling analysis shows that the VP model, as configured in this 1 km simulation, does not fully resolve the intermittency of sea ice deformation that is observed in satellite data.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, Daniel C</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Sinha, Bablu</author><author>Josey, Simon A</author><author>Boland, Emma J D</author><author>Meijers, Andrew J S</author><author>Shuckburgh, Emily</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Local and Remote Influences on the Heat Content of the Labrador Sea: An Adjoint Sensitivity Study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>2646-2667</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Labrador Sea</keyword><keyword>adjoint modeling</keyword><keyword>adjoint sensitivity</keyword><keyword>heat content</keyword><keyword>heat flux</keyword><keyword>teleconnection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2018JC013774</electronic-resource-num><notes>Jones, D.

Using an observationally constrained ocean adjoint model, we find that annual?mean Labrador Sea heat content is sensitive to temperature/salinity changes (1) along potential source water pathways (e.g., the subpolar gyre, the North Atlantic Current, the Gulf Stream) and (2) along the West African and European shelves, which are not significant source water regions for the Labrador Sea. The West African coastal/shelf adjustment mechanism, which may be excited by changes in along?shelf wind stress, involves pressure anomalies that propagate along a coastal waveguide toward Greenland, changing the across?shelf pressure gradient in the North Atlantic and altering heat convergence in the Labrador Sea. We also find that nonlocal (in space and time) heat fluxes (e.g., in the Irminger Sea, the seas south of Iceland) can have a strong impact on Labrador Sea heat content. Understanding and predicting the state of the Labrador Sea and its potential impacts on North Atlantic climate and global surface warming will require monitoring of oceanic and atmospheric properties at remote sites in the Irminger Sea, the subpolar gyre, and along the West African and European shelf/coast system, among others.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stewart, Andrew L</author><author>Klocker, Andreas</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circum-Antarctic Shoreward Heat Transport Derived From an Eddy- and Tide-Resolving Simulation</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>834-845</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Antarctic margins</keyword><keyword>eddies</keyword><keyword>heat flux</keyword><keyword>modeling</keyword><keyword>overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017GL075677</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stewart, A.

This study quantifies the roles of mean and transient flows in transporting heat across almost the entire Antarctic continental slope and shelf using an ocean/sea ice model run at eddy- and tide-resolving (1/48°) horizontal resolution. Heat transfer by transient flows is approximately attributed to eddies and tides via a decomposition into time scales shorter than and longer than 1 day, respectively. It is shown that eddies transfer heat across the continental slope (ocean depths greater than 1,500 m), but tides produce a stronger shoreward heat flux across the shelf break (ocean depths between 500 m and 1,000 m). However, the tidal heat fluxes are approximately compensated by mean flows, leaving the eddy heat flux to balance the net shoreward heat transport. The eddy-driven cross-slope overturning circulation is too weak to account for the eddy heat flux. This suggests that isopycnal eddy stirring is the principal mechanism of shoreward heat transport around Antarctica, though likely modulated by tides and surface forcing.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Landerer, Felix W</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tide gauge records reveal improved processing of gravity recovery and climate experiment time-variable mass solutions over the coastal ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><pages>1401-1412</pages><volume>214</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/gji/ggy207</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

MC solutions can explain ≳ 42 per cent of the monthly variance in TG time-series over broad shelf regions and in semi-enclosed marginal seas. MC solutions also generally explain ~ 5–32 per cent more TG data variance than SH estimates. Applying a coastline resolution improvement algorithm in the GRACE data processing leads to ~ 31 per cent more variance in TG records explained by the MC solution on average compared to not using this algorithm. Synthetic observations sampled from an ocean general circulation model exhibit similar patterns of correspondence between modelled TG and MC time-series and differences between MC and SH time-series in terms of their relationship with TG time-series, suggesting that observational results here are generally consistent with expectations from ocean dynamics. This work demonstrates the improved quality of recent MC solutions compared to earlier SH estimates over the coastal ocean, and suggests that the MC solutions could be a useful tool for understanding contemporary coastal sea level variability and change.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Delman, Andrew S.</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Qiu, Bo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual to Multidecadal Forcing of Mesoscale Eddy Kinetic Energy in the Subtropical Southern Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018JC013945</electronic-resource-num><notes>Delman, A.

The interannual and decadal changes in eddy activity in the SSIO eddy band, as represented by the variability of eddy kinetic energy (EKE), have implications for the large‐scale circulation, mixed‐layer budgets, and biological activity. An analysis of nearly two and a half decades of sea level anomaly (SLA) data from merged satellite altimetry shows that, in the southeast Indian Ocean east of 90°E, the variations of EKE and SLA are positively correlated on interannual and decadal time scales. Moreover, EKE exhibits a multidecadal increasing linear trend that corresponds to an increasing trend of SLA in the region. The EKE‐SLA covariability in the southeast Indian Ocean does not appear to be associated with a preference for anticyclonic over cyclonic eddy activity; rather, it can be attributed to the common remote forcing from the tropical Pacific associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In the west central SSIO, wind stress curl just south of the eddy band forces potential vorticity anomalies that affect conditions for instability in the west central SSIO; potential density and potential vorticity gradient anomalies also suggest a remote forcing mechanism originating in the region southwest of Australia. The interannual to multidecadal variability of EKE in the SSIO and its relationship with large‐scale SLA has implications for mixed‐layer dynamics and biogeochemistry and provides a basis for assessment of model simulations of eddy activity in the region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhu, Yanan</author><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Lin, Xiaopei</author><author>Wang, Fan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual Eddy Kinetic Energy Modulations in the Agulhas Return Current</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>6449-6462</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018JC014333</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhu, Y., Qiu, B., Lin, X., &amp;amp; Wang, F.

The wind‐forced sea surface height anomalies influence the upstream Agulhas Current volume transports. By modulating the intensity of barotropic instability of the ARC mean flow centered around the retroflection region, the Agulhas Current inflow variability leads to the downstream interannual eddy kinetic energy fluctuations in the ARC region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Xiao</author><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Chen, Shuiming</author><author>Cheng, Xuhua</author><author>Qi, Yiquan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual Modulations of the 50-Day Oscillations in the Celebes Sea: Dynamics and Impact</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>4666-4679</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018JC013960</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chen, X., Qiu, B., Chen, S., Cheng, X., &amp;amp; Qi, Y.

Using the ocean state estimate of 1993–2016 from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II, we detected strong interannual modulations in the shedding of cyclonic eddies at the Celebes Sea entrance. Active eddy sheddings occurred during 1993, 2002–2003, 2006–2010, and 2013–2015. Southward shifting of the wind‐driven North Pacific tropical gyre and the concurrent strengthening of the Mindanao Current southeast of the Mindanao Island in these years are found to be inducive for the generation of cyclonic eddies intruding into the Celebes Sea. Modulated by the activity of eddy sheddings, the upper ocean water mass properties in both the Celebes Sea and Makassar Strait exhibit noticeable interannual changes with less saline waters appearing in the 75‐ to 175‐m layer during the active eddy shedding years.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wei, Jianfen</author><author>Zhang, Xiangdong</author><author>Wang, Zhaomin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impacts of extratropical storm tracks on Arctic sea ice export through Fram Strait</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-018-4254-8</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wei, J., Zhang, X., &amp;amp; Wang, Z.

To improve understanding of changes in Arctic sea ice mass balance, we examined the impacts of the changed storm tracks and cyclone activity on Arctic sea ice export through Fram Strait by using a high resolution global ocean–sea ice model, MITgcm–ECCO2. The model was forced by the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25) dataset. The results show that storm-induced strong northerly wind stress can cause simultaneous response of daily sea ice export and, in turn, exert cumulative effects on interannual variability and long-term changes of sea ice export. Further analysis indicates that storm impact on sea ice export is spatially dependent. The storms occurring southeast of Fram Strait exhibit the largest impacts. The weakened intensity of winter (in this study winter is defined as October–March and summer as April–September) storms in this region after 1994/95 could be responsible for the decrease of total winter sea ice export during the same time period.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoteit, Ibrahim</author><author>Luo, Xiaodong</author><author>Bocquet, Marc</author><author>Kӧhl, Armin</author><author>Ait-El-Fquih, Boujemaa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Data Assimilation in Oceanography: Current Status and New Directions</title><secondary-title>New Frontiers in Operational Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Frontiers in Operational Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>465-511</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>GODAE OceanView</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.17125/gov2018.ch17</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hoteit, I., Luo, X., Bocquet, M., Kӧhl, A., &amp;amp; Ait-El-Fquih, B.

Previous studies of Totten Ice Shelf have employed surface velocity measurements to estimate its mass balance and understand its sensitivities to interannual changes in climate forcing. However, displacement measurements acquired over timescales of days to weeks may not accurately characterize long-term flow rates wherein ice velocity fluctuates with the seasons. Quantifying annual mass budgets or analyzing interannual changes in ice velocity requires knowing when and where observations of glacier velocity could be aliased by subannual variability. Here, we analyze 16 years of velocity data for Totten Ice Shelf, which we generate at subannual resolution by applying feature-tracking algorithms to several hundred satellite image pairs. We identify a seasonal cycle characterized by a spring to autumn speedup of more than 100myr−1 close to the ice front. The amplitude of the seasonal cycle diminishes with distance from the open ocean, suggesting the presence of a resistive back stress at the ice front that is strongest in winter. Springtime acceleration precedes summer surface melt and is not attributable to thinning from basal melt. We attribute the onset of ice shelf acceleration each spring to the loss of buttressing from the breakup of seasonal landfast sea ice. ]]&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Junjie</author><author>Bowman, Kevin W.</author><author>Parazoo, Nicholas C</author><author>Bloom, A Anthony</author><author>Wunch, Debra</author><author>Jiang, Zhe</author><author>Gurney, Kevin R</author><author>Schimel, Dave</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detecting drought impact on terrestrial biosphere carbon fluxes over contiguous US with satellite observations</title><secondary-title>Environmental Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>095003</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1748-9326/aad5ef</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liu, J., Bowman, K.

A new Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) model is presented to reconstruct surface ocean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) over the global ocean. The model consists of two steps: (1) reconstruction of pCO2 climatology and (2) reconstruction of pCO2 anomalies with respect to the climatology. For the first step, a gridded climatology was used as the target, along with sea surface salinity and temperature (SSS and SST), sea surface height (SSH), chlorophyll a (Chl), mixed layer depth (MLD), as well as latitude and longitude as predictors. For the second step, data from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) provided the target. The same set of predictors was used during step 2 augmented by their anomalies. During each step, the FFNN model reconstructs the non-linear relations between pCO2 and the ocean predictors. It provides monthly surface ocean pCO2 distributions on a 1ºx1º grid for the period 2001&amp;ndash;2016. Global ocean pCO2 was reconstructed with a satisfying accuracy compared to independent observational data from SOCAT. However, errors are larger in regions with poor data coverage (e.g. Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, subpolar Pacific). The model captured the strong interannual variability of surface ocean pCO2 with reasonable skills over the Equatorial Pacific associated with ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation). Our model was compared to three pCO2 mapping methods that participated in the Surface Ocean pCO2 Mapping intercomparison (SOCOM) initiative. We found a good agreement in seasonal and interannual variabilty between the models over the global ocean. However, important differences still exist at the regional scale, especially in the Southern hemisphere and in particular, the Southern Pacific and the Indian Ocean, as these regions suffer from poor data-coverage. Large regional uncertainties in reconstructed surface ocean pCO2 and sea-air CO2 fluxes have a strong influence on global estimates of CO2 fluxes and trends.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McParland, Erin L.</author><author>Levine, Naomi M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of differential DMSP production and community composition in predicting variability of global surface DMSP concentrations</title><secondary-title>Limnology and Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Limnology and Oceanography</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/lno.11076</electronic-resource-num><notes>McParland, E.

The station is located in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. Almost 5000 daily observation files have been archived based on yearly scientific expeditions. These files have not been fully analysed until now. This study reports for the first time on the consistent and homogeneous data processing and analysis of the 15-year long time series. Daily coordinates are obtained using Precise Point Positioning (PPP) processing based on two approaches. The first approach is based on the Kalman filter and uses the RTKLIB open source library to produce daily solutions by unconventionally running the filter in the forward and backward direction. The second approach uses APPS web service and is based on GIPSY scientific processing engine. The two approaches show an excellent agreement with less than 3 mm rms error horizontally and 6 mm rms error vertically. The derived position time series is analysed in terms of trend, periodicity and noise characteristics. The noise of the time series was found to be power-law noise model with spectral index closer to flicker noise. In addition, several periodic signals were found at 5, 14, 183 and 362 days. Furthermore, most of the horizontal movement was found to be in the North direction at a rate of 11.23 ± 0.09 mm/y, whereas the rate in the East direction was estimated to be 1.46 ± 0.05 mm/y. Lastly, the 15-year long time series revealed a movement upwards at a rate of 0.79 ± 0.35 mm/y. Despite being an unattended station, Aboa provides one of the most continuous and longest GPS time series in Antarctica. Therefore, we believe that this research increases the awareness of local geophysical phenomena in a less reported area of the Antarctic continent.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gregor, Luke</author><author>Kok, Schalk</author><author>Monteiro, Pedro M.

Resolving and understanding the drivers of variability of CO2 in the Southern Ocean and its potential climate feedback is one of the major scientific challenges of the ocean-climate community. Here we use a regional approach on empirical estimates of pCO2 to understand the role that seasonal variability has in long-term CO2 changes in the Southern Ocean. Machine learning has become the preferred empirical modelling tool to interpolate time- and location-restricted ship measurements of pCO2. In this study we use an ensemble of three machine-learning products: support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) from Gregor et al. (2017), and the self-organising-map feed-forward neural network (SOM-FFN) method from Landschützer et al. (2016). The interpolated estimates of ΔpCO2 are separated into nine regions in the Southern Ocean defined by basin (Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic) and biomes (as defined by Fay and McKinley, 2014a). The regional approach shows that, while there is good agreement in the overall trend of the products, there are periods and regions where the confidence in estimated ΔpCO2 is low due to disagreement between the products. The regional breakdown of the data highlighted the seasonal decoupling of the modes for summer and winter interannual variability. Winter interannual variability had a longer mode of variability compared to summer, which varied on a 4–6-year timescale. We separate the analysis of the ΔpCO2 and its drivers into summer and winter. We find that understanding the variability of ΔpCO2 and its drivers on shorter timescales is critical to resolving the long-term variability of ΔpCO2. Results show that ΔpCO2 is rarely driven by thermodynamics during winter, but rather by mixing and stratification due to the stronger correlation of ΔpCO2 variability with mixed layer depth. Summer pCO2 variability is consistent with chlorophyll a variability, where higher concentrations of chlorophyll a correspond with lower pCO2 concentrations. In regions of low chlorophyll a concentrations, wind stress and sea surface temperature emerged as stronger drivers of ΔpCO2. In summary we propose that sub-decadal variability is explained by summer drivers, while winter variability contributes to the long-term changes associated with the SAM. This approach is a useful framework to assess the drivers of ΔpCO2 but would greatly benefit from improved estimates of ΔpCO2 and a longer time series.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schlegel, Nicole-Jeanne</author><author>Seroussi, Hélène</author><author>Schodlok, Michael P.</author><author>Larour, Eric Y.</author><author>Boening, Carmen</author><author>Limonadi, Daniel</author><author>Watkins, Michael M.</author><author>Morlighem, Mathieu</author><author>van den Broeke, Michiel R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploration of Antarctic Ice Sheet 100-year contribution to sea level rise and associated model uncertainties using the ISSM framework</title><secondary-title>The Cryosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cryosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>3511-3534</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/tc-12-3511-2018</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schlegel, N.-J., Seroussi, H., Schodlok, M.

Estimating the future evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is critical for improving future sea level rise (SLR) projections. Numerical ice sheet models are invaluable tools for bounding Antarctic vulnerability; yet, few continental-scale projections of century-scale AIS SLR contribution exist, and those that do vary by up to an order of magnitude. This is partly because model projections of future sea level are inherently uncertain and depend largely on the model's boundary conditions and climate forcing, which themselves are unknown due to the uncertainty in the projections of future anthropogenic emissions and subsequent climate response. Here, we aim to improve the understanding of how uncertainties in model forcing and boundary conditions affect ice sheet model simulations. With use of sampling techniques embedded within the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) framework, we assess how uncertainties in snow accumulation, ocean-induced melting, ice viscosity, basal friction, bedrock elevation, and the presence of ice shelves impact continental-scale 100-year model simulations of AIS future sea level contribution. Overall, we find that AIS sea level contribution is strongly affected by grounding line retreat, which is driven by the magnitude of ice shelf basal melt rates and by variations in bedrock topography. In addition, we find that over 1.2m of AIS global mean sea level contribution over the next century is achievable, but not likely, as it is tenable only in response to unrealistically large melt rates and continental ice shelf collapse. Regionally, we find that under our most extreme 100-year warming experiment generalized for the entire ice sheet, the Amundsen Sea sector is the most significant source of model uncertainty (1032mm 6σ spread) and the region with the largest potential for future sea level contribution (297mm). In contrast, under a more plausible forcing informed regionally by literature and model sensitivity studies, the Ronne basin has a greater potential for local increases in ice shelf basal melt rates. As a result, under this more likely realization, where warm waters reach the continental shelf under the Ronne ice shelf, it is the Ronne basin, particularly the Evans and Rutford ice streams, that are the greatest contributors to potential SLR (161mm) and to simulation uncertainty (420mm 6σ spread). ]]&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Naughten, Kaitlin A.</author><author>Meissner, Katrin J.</author><author>Galton-Fenzi, Benjamin K.</author><author>England, Matthew H.</author><author>Timmermann, Ralph</author><author>Hellmer, Hartmut H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Future Projections of Antarctic Ice Shelf Melting Based on CMIP5 Scenarios</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>5243-5261</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0854.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Naughten, K.

Using 13 years of shipboard ADCP transects in Drake Passage, we show that internal waves account for more than half of the upper-ocean kinetic energy at scales between 10-40 km; a transi- tion from the dominance of geostrophic flow to inertia-gravity waves occurs at 40 km. We further show that a global numerical model with embedded tides reproduces this partitioning between upper-ocean geostrophic flows and inertia-gravity waves. Using the output of this model, we show that in the Kuroshio Extension upper-ocean sub- mesoscale (10-100 km) geostrophic flow and inertia-gravity waves undergo vigorous seasonal cycles that are out of phase: geostrophic flows peak in late winter/early spring, while the projection of inertia-gravity waves at the surface peaks in late summer/early fall. The observational and modeling evidence of the importance of both geostrophic flows and internal gravity waves at mesoscales to submesoscales hints on the interaction between these two types of flow. To better understand these interactions, we analyze a simple model that couples barotropic quasi-geostrophic flow and near-inertial waves. There are two mechanisms of energy transfer from geostrophic flow to externally forced near-inertial waves: the refractive convergence of the wave action density into anti- cyclones (and divergence from cyclones); and the enhancement of wave-field gradients by geostrophic straining. Unforced inviscid numerical solutions of this reduced model reveal that geostrophic straining accounts for most of stimulated generation, which represents 10-20% of the decay of the initial balanced energy. Consideration of the dissipative problem reveals that wave dissipation generates both quasi-geostrophic po- tential vorticity locally and geostrophic kinetic energy. This wave streaming mechanism is non-negligible in forced-dissipative solutions, which equilibrate even without bottom drag. In a separate study, we derive a Galerkin approximation for the surface-active quasi-geostrophic system using standard vertical modes. While the Galerkin expansions of streamfunction and potential vorticity do not satisfy the inversion relation exactly, the series converge with no Gibbs oscillations. With enough modes, the Galerkin series provide a good approximation to the streamfunction throughout the domain, which can be used to advect potential vorticity in the interior and buoyancy at the surfaces.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mu, Longjiang</author><author>Yang, Qinghua</author><author>Losch, Martin</author><author>Losa, Svetlana N.</author><author>Ricker, Robert</author><author>Nerger, Lars</author><author>Liang, Xi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving sea ice thickness estimates by assimilating CryoSat-2 and SMOS sea ice thickness data simultaneously</title><secondary-title>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>529-538</pages><volume>144</volume><issue>711</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/qj.3225</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mu, L., Yang, Q., Losch, M., Losa, S.

They are not only crucial for energy conversion among dynamics at diﬀerent scales, but also for materials transport across the basin. This thesis focuses on studying the characteristics of Red Sea eddies, including their temporal and spatial properties, their energy budget, the mechanisms of their evolution, and their predictability. Remote sensing data, in-situ observations, the oceanic general circulation model, and data assimilation techniques were employed in this thesis. The eddies in the Red Sea were ﬁrst identiﬁed using altimeter data by applying an improved winding-angle method, based on which the statistical properties of those eddies were derived. The results suggested that eddies occur more frequently in the central basin of the Red Sea and exhibit a signiﬁcant seasonal variation. The mechanisms of the eddies’ evolution, particularly the eddy kinetic energy budget, were then investigated based on the outputs of a long-term eddy resolving numerical model conﬁgured for the Red Sea with realistic forcing. Examination of the energy budget revealed that the eddies acquire the vast majority of kinetic energy through conversion of eddy available potential energy via baroclinic instability, which is intensiﬁed during winter. The possible factors modulating the behavior of the several observed eddies in the Red Sea were then revealed by conducting a sensitivity analysis using the adjoint model. These eddies were found to exhibit diﬀerent sensitivities to external forcings, suggesting diﬀerent mechanisms for their evolution. This is the ﬁrst known adjoint sensitivity study on speciﬁc eddy events in the Red Sea and was hitherto not previously appreciated. The last chapter examines the predictability of Red Sea eddies using an ensemble-based forecasting and assimilation system. The forecast sea surface height was used to evaluate the overall performance of the short-term eddy predictability. Diﬀerent ensemble sampling schemes were implemented, and the investigation among diﬀerent schemes is followed by a discussion of performance and challenges based on the results of a case study. The thesis not only enhances understanding of the Red Sea dynamics, but also deepens knowledge of the physical-biological and air-sea interactions within the basin. Further, it is a stepping stone to building a robust regional operational system with reﬁned forecasting skills.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Haiyuan</author><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Chang, Ping</author><author>Wu, Lixin</author><author>Wang, Shengpeng</author><author>Chen, Zhaohui</author><author>Yang, Yun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decadal Variability of Eddy Characteristics and Energetics in the Kuroshio Extension: Unstable Versus Stable States</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>6653-6669</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018JC014081</electronic-resource-num><notes>Yang, H., Qiu, B., Chang, P., Wu, L., Wang, S., Chen, Z., &amp;amp; Yang, Y.

A coupled atmosphere–ocean–wave model was used to examine mixing in the upper-oceanic layers under the influence of a very severe cyclonic storm Phailin over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during 10–14 October 2013. The coupled model was found to improve the sea surface temperature over the uncoupled model. Model simulations highlight the prominent role of cyclone-induced near-inertial oscillations in subsurface mixing up to the thermocline depth. The inertial mixing introduced by the cyclone played a central role in the deepening of the thermocline and mixed layer depth by 40 and 15m, respectively. For the first time over the BoB, a detailed analysis of inertial oscillation kinetic energy generation, propagation, and dissipation was carried out using an atmosphere–ocean–wave coupled model during a cyclone. A quantitative estimate of kinetic energy in the oceanic water column, its propagation, and its dissipation mechanisms were explained using the coupled atmosphere–ocean–wave model. The large shear generated by the inertial oscillations was found to overcome the stratification and initiate mixing at the base of the mixed layer. Greater mixing was found at the depths where the eddy kinetic diffusivity was large. The baroclinic current, holding a larger fraction of kinetic energy than the barotropic current, weakened rapidly after the passage of the cyclone. The shear induced by inertial oscillations was found to decrease rapidly with increasing depth below the thermocline. The dampening of the mixing process below the thermocline was explained through the enhanced dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy upon approaching the thermocline layer. The wave–current interaction and nonlinear wave–wave interaction were found to affect the process of downward mixing and cause the dissipation of inertial oscillations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vaňková, Irena</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ice and Ocean Dynamics in a Glacier Fjord</title></titles><periodical/><pages>178</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><notes>Vaňková, I.

Greenland’s fjords play the important role of connecting glacier termini with the con- tinental shelf and exposing them to oceanic variability, affecting ice-sheet stability via variable melt rates at the ice-ocean interface. Observations collected in Sermilik Fjord were used to identify timescales of hydrographic variability of deep, warm waters and an ocean state estimate was used to identify sources of this variability. It is shown that inter- annual variability is set by the extent of deep convection in the Irminger Sea. Furthermore, it is found that seasonal variability in fjord density is introduced at the continental shelf break by Ekman transport, which in turn governs seasonal variability of the fjord’s deep hydrographic properties due to the presence of vertical temperature and salinity gradients. The ice mélange is a mixture of sea ice and icebergs, which can be important for glacier stability, due to its potential to provide backstress via buttressing, preventing calving. A new approach to modeling the ice mélange is developed here. The rheology of an existing continuum sea-ice model is modified to incorporate the mechanical effect of icebergs and a semi-Lagrangian time-stepping scheme is adopted to preserve iceberg shape through time. Meltwater transport through glaciers affects material properties of glacial ice and controls the ice flow by setting its boundary conditions. However, since the glacial interior is under-observed in both space and time, little is known about how this meltwater trans- port occurs. New observations of the glacier interior showed a diurnal signal consistent with the existence of an englacial diurnal meltwater cycle, indicating a dense and complex hydrologic network inside the glacier. Barotropic waves in glacier fjords and their relation to calving were explored. Observa- tional data from high-frequency pressure sensors placed in an array on the fjord sea floor captured tsunamis which were proceeded by large calving events. A numerical model was used to infer the forcing at the glacier-ocean boundary producing these tsunamis, yielding a timescale over which calving at Helheim Glacier occurs.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foukal, Nicholas P</author><author>Lozier, M Susan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Examining the Origins of Ocean Heat Content Variability in the Eastern North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>11,211-275,283</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>Lagrangian trajectories</keyword><keyword>Overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>Subpolar gyre</keyword><keyword>Subtropical gyre</keyword><keyword>heat budget</keyword><keyword>ocean heat content</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018GL079122</electronic-resource-num><notes>Foukal, N.

Heat budgets reveal that while the OHC seasonal cycle is driven by air-sea fluxes, interannual OHC variability is driven by both air-sea fluxes and the divergence of ocean heat transport, the latter of which is dominated by the oceanic flux through the southern face of the study area. Lagrangian trajectories initialized along the southern face and run backward in time indicate that interannual variability in the subtropical-origin volume flux (i.e., the upper limb of the overturning circulation) drives variability in the temperature flux through the southern face. As such, the heat carried by the imported subtropical waters is an important component of the eastern subpolar gyre heat budget on interannual time scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hameed, Sultan</author><author>Wolfe, Christopher L P</author><author>Chi, Lequan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of the Atlantic Meridional Mode on Gulf Stream North Wall Position</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>8875-8894</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0098.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hameed, S., Wolfe, C.

Previous work in the literature has considered processes related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in triggering latitudinal displacements of the North Wall position. This paper presents evidence that the Atlantic meridional mode (AMM) also impacts interannual variations of the North Wall position. The AMM signal from the tropics propagates to the Gulf Stream near the 200-m depth, and there are two time scales for this interaction. Anomalous Ekman suction induced by AMM cools the tropical Atlantic. The cold water in the Caribbean Sea is entrained into the currents feeding the Gulf Stream, and this cooling signal reaches the North Wall within a year. A second mechanism involves cold anomalies in the western tropical Atlantic, which initially propagate westward as baroclinic planetary waves, reaching the Gulf Stream and resulting in a southward shift in the North Wall position after a delay of about one year. In an analysis for the period 1961–2015, AMM’s signal dominates North Wall fluctuations in the upper 300 m, while NAO is the major influence below ~500 m; the influence of both the teleconnections is seen between 300 and 500 m. The relationship between the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and the North Wall is investigated for the 2005–15 period and found to be statistically significant only at the sea surface in one of the three North Wall indices used.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Filmer, M.

The influences of intensified SH westerlies on the Antarctic coastal waters are still not clear. The variability of Antarctic Continental Shelf Bottom Water (ASBW) temperature is crucial for ice shelf basal melting and hence ice shelf mass balance in Antarctica. In order to understand the impacts of SH westerlies on the variability of ASBW temperature, atmospheric forcing in 1992 with weak westerlies and in 1998 with strong westerlies are used to drive a high-resolution ocean-sea ice general circulation model, MITgcm-ECCO2. Our simulated results show that under the atmospheric forcing in 1998, the ASBW becomes warmer in most regions around Antarctica except the coastal region between 60°–150°W, than for the case under atmospheric forcing in 1992. The warming of ASBW around Antarctica is due to the intense shoaling and warming of CDW induced by enhanced Ekman pumping as well as strengthened subpolar gyres. The strengthened subpolar gyres favor the transportation of warm water to the coast of Antarctica. The cooling of ASBW along the coast of the western Antarctic Peninsula is caused by stronger coastal currents, which bring colder water downstream from the northwest flank of the Weddell Sea.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strobach, Ehud</author><author>Molod, Andrea</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Consequences of different air-sea feedbacks on ocean using MITgcm and MERRA-2 forcing: Implications for coupled data assimilation systems</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>91-111</pages><volume>132</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2018.10.006</electronic-resource-num><notes>Strobach, E., Molod, A., Forget, G., Campin, J.-M., Hill, C., Menemenlis, D., &amp;amp; Heimbach, P.

Future climate warming of the Arctic could potentially enhance the load of terrigenous dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) of Arctic rivers due to increased carbon mobilization within watersheds. A greater flux of tDOC might impact the biogeochemical processes of the coastal Arctic Ocean (AO) and ultimately its capacity to absorb atmospheric CO2. In this study, we show that sea-surface tDOC concentrations simulated by a physical–biogeochemical coupled model in the Canadian Beaufort Sea for 2003–2011 compare favorably with estimates retrieved by satellite imagery. Our results suggest that, over spring–summer, tDOC of riverine origin contributes to 35% of primary production and that an equivalent of ∼10% of tDOC is exported westwards with the potential of fueling the biological production of the eastern Alaskan nearshore waters. The combination of model and satellite data provides promising results to extend this work to the entire AO so as to quantify, in conjunction with in situ data, the expected changes in tDOC fluxes and their potential impact on the AO biogeochemistry at basin scale.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Viglione, Giuliana A.</author><author>Thompson, Andrew F.</author><author>Flexas, M.

Leads and pressure ridges are dominant features of the Arctic sea ice cover. Not only do they affect heat loss and surface drag, but also provide insight into the underlying physics of sea ice deformation. Due to their elongated shape they are referred as Linear Kinematic Features (LKFs). This paper introduces two methods that detect and track LKFs in sea ice deformation data and establish an LKF data set for the entire observing period of the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS). Both algorithms are available as open-source code and applicable to any gridded sea-ice drift and deformation data. The LKF detection algorithm classifies pixels with higher deformation rates compared to the immediate environment as LKF pixels, divides the binary LKF map into small segments, and re-connects multiple segments into individual LKFs based their distance and orientation relative to each other. The tracking algorithm uses sea-ice drift information to estimate a first guess of LKF distribution and identifies tracked features by the degree of overlap between detected features and the first guess. An optimization of the parameters of both algorithms is presented, as well as an extensive evaluation of both algorithms against hand-picked features in a reference data set. An LKF data set is derived from RGPS deformation data for the years from 1996 to 2008 that enables a comprehensive description of LKFs. LKF densities and LKF intersection angles derived from this data set agree well with previous estimates. Further, a power-law distribution of LKF length, an exponential distribution of LKF lifetimes, and a strong link to atmospheric drivers, here Arctic cyclones, is derived from the data set. Both algorithms are applied to output of a numerical sea-ice model to compare the LKF intersection angles in a high-resolution Arctic sea-ice simulation with the LKF data set.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Acoustic Tomography in the North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>JTECH-D-18-0082.1</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JTECH-D-18-0082.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dushaw, B.

An increasing number of Southern Ocean models now include Antarctic ice-shelf cavities, and simulate thermodynamics at the ice-shelf/ocean interface. This adds another level of complexity to Southern Ocean simulations, as ice shelves interact directly with the ocean and indirectly with sea ice. Here, we present the first model intercomparison and evaluation of present-day ocean/sea-ice/ice-shelf interactions, as simulated by two models: a circumpolar Antarctic configuration of MetROMS (ROMS: Regional Ocean Modelling System coupled to CICE: Community Ice CodE) and the global model FESOM (Finite Element Sea-ice Ocean Model), where the latter is run at two different levels of horizontal resolution. From a circumpolar Antarctic perspective, we compare and evaluate simulated ice-shelf basal melting and sub-ice-shelf circulation, as well as sea-ice properties and Southern Ocean water mass characteristics as they influence the sub-ice-shelf processes. Despite their differing numerical methods, the two models produce broadly similar results and share similar biases in many cases. Both models reproduce many key features of observations but struggle to reproduce others, such as the high melt rates observed in the small warm-cavity ice shelves of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas. Several differences in model design show a particular influence on the simulations. For example, FESOM's greater topographic smoothing can alter the geometry of some ice-shelf cavities enough to affect their melt rates; this improves at higher resolution, since less smoothing is required. In the interior Southern Ocean, the vertical coordinate system affects the degree of water mass erosion due to spurious diapycnal mixing, with MetROMS' terrain-following coordinate leading to more erosion than FESOM's z coordinate. Finally, increased horizontal resolution in FESOM leads to higher basal melt rates for small ice shelves, through a combination of stronger circulation and small-scale intrusions of warm water from offshore.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Ferrari, Raffaele</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>100 Years of the Ocean General Circulation</title><secondary-title>Meteorological Monographs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Meteorological Monographs</full-title></periodical><pages>7.1-7.32</pages><volume>59</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/AMSMONOGRAPHS-D-18-0002.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., &amp;amp; Ferrari, R.

Calving front dynamics is an important control on Greenland's ice mass balance. Ice front retreat of marine-terminating glaciers may, for example, lead to a loss in resistive stress, which ultimately results in glacier acceleration and thinning. Over the past decade, it has been suggested that such retreats may be triggered by warm and salty Atlantic water, which is typically found at a depth below 200&amp;ndash;300m. An increase in subglacial water discharge at glacier ice fronts due to enhanced surface runoff may also be responsible for an intensification of undercutting and calving. An increase in ocean thermal forcing or subglacial discharge therefore has the potential to destabilize marine terminating glaciers along the coast of Greenland. It remains unclear which glaciers are currently stable but may retreat in the future, and how far inland and how fast they will retreat. Here, we quantify the sensitivity and vulnerability of marine-terminating glaciers along the Northwest coast of Greenland (from 72.5º to 76ºN) to the ocean forcing and subglacial discharge using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). We rely on the undercutting parameterization based on ocean thermal forcing and subglacial discharge, and use ocean temperature and salinity from high-resolution ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation &amp; Climate of the Ocean, Phase II) simulations at the fjords mouth to constrain the ocean thermal forcing. The ice flow model includes a calving law based on a tensile Von Mises criterion. While these parameterizations remain approximations and do not include all the physical processes at play, they have been shown to provide reliable estimates of undercutting and calving rates, respectively, on a number of glaciers along the coast of Greenland. We find that some glaciers, such as Dietrichson Gletscher or Alison Gletscher, are sensitive to small increases in ocean thermal forcing, while others, such as Illullip Sermia or Cornell Gletscher, are remarkably stable and remain stable, even in a 3-degree ocean warming scenario. Under the most intense experiment, we find that Hayes Gletscher retreats by more than 50km inland into a deep trough and its velocity increases by a factor of 10 over only 15 years. The model confirms that ice-ocean interactions can trigger extensive and rapid glacier retreat, but the bed controls the rate and magnitude of the retreat. Under current oceanic and atmospheric condition, we find that this sector alone will contribute more than 1cm to sea level, and up to 3cm under the most extreme scenario.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van der Stocken, Tom</author><author>Carroll, Dustin</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Simard, Marc</author><author>Koedam, Nico</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global-scale dispersal and connectivity in mangroves</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>201812470</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1812470116</electronic-resource-num><notes>Van der Stocken, T., Carroll, D., Menemenlis, D., Simard, M., &amp;amp; Koedam, N.

For mangroves, which are highly susceptible to climate change, the spatial scale of dispersal remains largely unknown. Here we use a high-resolution, eddy- and tide-resolving numerical ocean model to simulate mangrove propagule dispersal across the global ocean and generate connectivity matrices between mangrove habitats using a range of floating periods. We find high rates of along-coast transport and transoceanic dispersal across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. No connectivity is observed between populations on either side of the American and African continents. Archipelagos, such as the Galapagos and those found in Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia, act as critical stepping-stones for dispersal across the Pacific Ocean. Direct and reciprocal dispersal routes across the Indian Ocean via the South Equatorial Current and seasonally reversing monsoon currents, respectively, allow connectivity between western Indian Ocean and Indo-West Pacific sites. We demonstrate the isolation of the Hawaii Islands and help explain the presence of mangroves on the latitudinal outlier Bermuda. Finally, we find that dispersal distance and connectivity are highly sensitive to the minimum and maximum floating periods. We anticipate that our findings will guide future research agendas to quantify biophysical factors that determine mangrove dispersal and connectivity, including the influence of ocean surface water properties on metabolic processes and buoyancy behavior, which may determine the potential of viably reaching a suitable habitat. Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding of global mangrove species distributions and their response to changing climate conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, Nan</author><author>Li, Jiancheng</author><author>Ray, Jim</author><author>Chen, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved geophysical excitation of length-of-day constrained by Earth orientation parameters and satellite gravimetry products</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><pages>1633-1651</pages><volume>214</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/gji/ggy204</electronic-resource-num><notes>Yu, N., Li, J., Ray, J., &amp;amp; Chen, W.

But, neither agreement among different geophysical models for the fluid dynamics nor consistency with geodetic observations of LOD has reached satisfactory levels. This is mainly ascribed to significant discrepancies and uncertainties in the theories and assumptions adopted by different modelling groups, in their numerical methods, and in the accuracy and coverage of global input data fields. Based on careful comparisons with more accurate geodetic measurements and satellite gravimetry products (from satellite laser ranging, SLR), observed LOD and C20 geopotential time-series can provide strong constraints to evaluate or form combined geophysical models. In this study, wavelet decomposition is used to extract several narrow-band components to compare in addition to considering the total signals. We then make refinements to the least difference combination (LDC) method proposed by Chen et al., to form multimodel geophysical excitations. Two combination variants, called the weighted mean combination (WMC2 and WMC4), are also evaluated. All the multimodel methods attempt to extract the best-modelled frequency components from each geophysical model by relying on geodetic excitation and the C20 series as references. The comparative performances of the three combinations LDC, WMC2 and WMC4 and the original single models are determined. We find that (1) Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean and Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology Ocean Model give a more reliable view of the ocean redistributions than the Ocean Model for Circulation and Tides used by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, especially for the annual component; (2) C20 series from SLR can provide a rigorous constraint for the total matter excitation of the geophysical fluids, especially for broad-band parts; (3) the Sea-Level Angular Momentum functions term, correcting for sea-level effects (global mass balance) put forward by the Earth System Modelling group at GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, can significantly improve the Hydrospheric Effective Angular Momentum functions matter terms; (4) the LDC/WMC combinations are much better than the original individual geophysical model excitations, reducing the magnitude of unexplained LOD excitations to roughly the 10 μs level; (5) the level of residual LOD variations after removing models or model combinations is remarkably invariant with respect to LOD periods between ∼2 months and ∼3 yr, being 12–14 μs for the best original models and 7–12 μs for our combinations; (6) while differences between the IERS 14C04 and the JPL SPACE2015 geodetic LOD time-series are not negligible, errors in both series are still not large compared to the geophysical models (for periods &gt;2 months) so the impact on excitation studies is minimal except at semiannual periods and usually 14C04 compares better with excitation models. The improved geophysical models are recommended to replace the original ones as they present overwhelming advantages.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wińska, Małgorzata</author><author>Śliwińska, Justyna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing hydrological signal in polar motion from observations and geophysical models</title><secondary-title>Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica</full-title></periodical><volume>63</volume><issue>2019</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11200-018-1028-z</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wińska, M., &amp;amp; Śliwińska, J.

Quantitative assessment of hydrological effects of polar motion remains unclear because of the lack of the observations and differences between various atmospheric and ocean models. We compare the effects of several hydrological excitation functions computed as the difference between the excitation function of polar motion Geodetic Angular Momentum (GAM) and joint atmospheric plus oceanic excitation functions, called geodetic residuals. Geodetic residuals are computed for different Atmospheric Angular Momentum (AAM) and Oceanic Angular Momentum (OAM) models and are analyzed and compared with the hydrological excitation function determined from the Land Surface Discharge Model. They are analyzed on decadal, interannual, seasonal and non-seasonal time scales. The equatorial components of hydrological geodetic excitation functions χ1 and χ2 are decomposed into prograde and retrograde time series by applying Complex Fourier Transform Models. The agreement between hydrological geodetic residuals and excitation functions is validated using Taylor diagrams. This shows that agreement is highly dependent on AAM and OAM models. Errors in these models affect the resulting geodetic residuals and have a strong impact on the Earth’s angular momentum budget.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bashmachnikov, I.

Seasonal and interannual variations in adjective heat fluxes in the ocean (dQ oc ) and the convergence of advective heat fluxes in the atmosphere (dQ atm ) in the Barents Sea region have been investigated over the period of 1993–2012 using the results of the MIT regional eddy-permitting model and ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis. Wavelet analysis and singular spectrum analysis are used to reveal concealed periodicities. Seasonal 2- to 4- and 5- to 8-year cycles are revealed in the dQ oc and dQ atm data. It is also found that seasonal variations in dQ oc are primarily determined by the integrated volume fluxes through the western boundary of the Barents Sea, whereas the 20-year trend is determined by the temperature variation of the transported water. A cross-wavelet analysis of dQ oc and dQ atm in the Barents Sea region shows that the seasonal variations in dQ oc and dQ atm are nearly in-phase, while their interannual variations are out-of-phase. It is concluded that the basin of the Barents Sea plays an important role in maintaining the feedback mechanism (the Bjerknes compensation) of the ocean–atmosphere system in the Arctic region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amrhein, Daniel E.</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Marchal, Olivier</author><author>Forget, Gael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A global glacial ocean state estimate constrained by upper-ocean temperature proxies</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>8059-8079</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>Abyssal circulation</keyword><keyword>Inverse methods</keyword><keyword>Ocean</keyword><keyword>Ocean models</keyword><keyword>Paleoclimate</keyword><keyword>Sea surface temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0769.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>uses coarser-res (2-deg) ECCO-V4 set-up</notes><research-notes>uses coarser-res (2-deg) ECCO-V4 set-up</research-notes><urls/><label>ECCO-V4</label><abstract>AbstractWe use the method of least squares with Lagrange multipliers to fit an ocean general circulation model to the Multiproxy Approach for the Reconstruction of the Glacial Ocean Surface (MARGO) estimate of near sea surface temperature (NSST) at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 23 - 19 thousand years ago).

Calving is an important mechanism that controls the dynamics of marine terminating glaciers of Greenland. Iceberg calving at the terminus affects the entire stress regime of outlet glaciers, which may lead to further retreat and ice flow acceleration. It is therefore critical to accurately parameterize calving in ice sheet models in order to improve the projections of ice sheet change over the coming decades and reduce the uncertainty in their contribution to sea-level rise. Several calving laws have been proposed, but most of them have been applied only to a specific region and have not been tested on other glaciers, while some others have only been implemented in 1-D flowline or vertical flowband models. Here, we test and compare several calving laws recently proposed in the literature using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). We test these calving laws on nine tidewater glaciers of Greenland. We compare the modeled ice front evolution to the observed retreat from Landsat data collected over the past 10 years, and assess which calving law has better predictive abilities for each glacier. Overall, the von Mises tensile stress calving law is more satisfactory than other laws for simulating observed ice front retreat, but new parameterizations that better capture the different modes of calving should be developed. Although the final positions of ice fronts are different for forecast simulations with different calving laws, our results confirm that ice front retreat highly depends on bed topography, irrespective of the calving law employed. This study also confirms that calving dynamics needs to be 3-D or in plan view in ice sheet models to account for complex bed topography and narrow fjords along the coast of Greenland. ]]&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pillar, Helen R</author><author>Johnson, Helen L</author><author>Marshall, David P</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Takao, So</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impacts of Atmospheric Reanalysis Uncertainty on Atlantic Overturning Estimates at 25°N</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>8719-8744</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0241.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Pillar, H.

In this study, the impact of uncertainty in surface fluxes of buoyancy and momentum on the modeled Atlantic meridional overturning at 25°N is quantified for the period January 1994?December 2011. By using an ocean-only climate model and its adjoint, the space and time origins of overturning uncertainty resulting from air?sea flux uncertainty are fully explored. Uncertainty in overturning induced by prior air?sea flux uncertainty can exceed 4 Sv (where 1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s?1) within 15 yr, at times exceeding the amplitude of the ensemble-mean overturning anomaly. A key result is that, on average, uncertainty in the overturning at 25°N is dominated by uncertainty in the zonal wind at lags of up to 6.5 yr and by uncertainty in surface heat fluxes thereafter, with winter heat flux uncertainty over the Labrador Sea appearing to play a critically important role.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Evans, Dafydd Gwyn</author><author>Zika, Jan D</author><author>Naveira Garabato, Alberto C</author><author>Nurser, A J George</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cold Transit of Southern Ocean Upwelling</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>13,313-386,395</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>Circumpolar Deep Water</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean overturning</keyword><keyword>air-ice-sea interactions</keyword><keyword>intermediate water</keyword><keyword>nonlinear EOS</keyword><keyword>seasonal transformation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018GL079986</electronic-resource-num><notes>Evans, D.

The time and zonal mean dynamics of this circulation describe the upwelling of Circumpolar Deep Water and the downwelling of Antarctic Intermediate Water. The thermodynamic drivers of the circulation and their seasonal cycle play a potentially key regulatory role. Here an observationally constrained ocean model and an observation-based seasonal climatology are analyzed from a thermodynamic perspective, to assess the diabatic processes controlling overturning in the Southern Ocean. This reveals a seasonal two-stage cold transit in the formation of intermediate water from upwelled deep water. First, relatively warm and saline deep water is transformed into colder and fresher near-surface winter water via wintertime mixing. Second, winter water warms to form intermediate water through summertime surface heat fluxes. The mixing-driven pathway from deep water to winter water follows mixing lines in thermohaline coordinates indicative of nonlinear processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Swart, S</author><author>Johnson, K</author><author>Mazloff, M R</author><author>Meijers, A</author><author>Meredith, M P</author><author>Newman, L</author><author>Sallée, Jean-Baptiste</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Southern Ocean in State of the Climate in 2017</title><secondary-title>Bull.

In that study, the thermally indirect, jet-scale overturning circulations (JSOCs) were detected in an eddy-resolving model simulation of the Southern Ocean. Here observational evidence of the existence of JSOCs is demonstrated by showing that the Argo floats tend to drift poleward across the jet with the maximum drift speed coinciding with the corresponding jet maximum. This finding has an implication for the observed deep mixed layer because it was previously shown that in the model the JSOCs play a key role in preconditioning the formation of a deep and narrow mixed layer at just similar to 1 degrees north of the Subantarctic Front. Plain Language Summary In the Southern Ocean, some of the deepest mixed layers from early to late winter have a meridional scale of only similar to 2 degrees and a depth of over 500 m. These mixed layers are thought to be a critical pathway for ocean ventilation of greenhouse gases and heat and thus considered as an important regulator of climate. Yet the mechanism for the key observed features of deep mixed layers is not well understood and is a subject of active research. This paper demonstrates observational evidence of an overturning circulation, which was theorized to exist and to help account for the observed feature of the deep mixed layer. Numerous efforts to understand the mechanism of the deep mixed layer are underway. Therefore, it is important to present this newly identified overturning circulation to the community in a timely manner.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Masich, Jessica</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Chereskin, Teresa K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interfacial Form Stress in the Southern Ocean State Estimate</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>3368-3385</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean state estimate</keyword><keyword>interfacial form stress</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>momentum balance</keyword><keyword>topographic form stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><isbn>2169-9275</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018JC013844</electronic-resource-num><notes>Masich, J., Mazloff, M.

These form stresses combine to help set the strength and structure of the Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation (MOC), a key nexus of heat and gas exchange between the deep ocean and the atmosphere. For the first time in a general circulation model, we calculate the time?varying, three?dimensional IFS field directly from zonal pressure gradients across vertical perturbations in isopycnal layer interfaces. We confirm previous findings that IFS compensates wind stress at the surface and topographic form stress at the seafloor in the Drake Passage latitudes. We find that zonal and time?mean IFS is primarily responsible for this surface wind stress compensation, with some contribution from transient eddy IFS. Mean, standing eddy, and transient eddy IFS combine to compensate topographic form stress at depth. Both standing and transient eddy IFS concentrate at stationary meanders along the ACC, and transient eddy IFS dominates standing eddy IFS in regions of high eddy kinetic energy. Finally, total IFS changes sign from balancing eastward wind stress to balancing westward topographic form stress around 28.1 kg m?3, close to the upper limit of Antarctic Bottom Water, indicating the role of buoyancy forcing in setting the structure of the IFS field.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Yu-Chiao</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Rosso, Isabella</author><author>Fang, Shih-Wei</author><author>Yu, Jin-Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Multi-variate Empirical Orthogonal Function Method to Construct Nitrate Maps in the Southern Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><isbn>0739-0572</isbn><electronic-resource-num>doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-18-0018.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liang, Y.-C., Mazloff, M.

The objective of this comparison is to assess the ability of the California State Estimate (CASE) to reproduce the key physical features of the CCS mean state, annual cycles, and interannual variability along the three sections of the California Underwater Glider Network (CUGN). The assessment focuses on several oceanic metrics deemed most important for characterizing physical variability in the CCS: 50-m potential temperature, 80-m salinity, and 26 kg m-3 isopycnal depth and salinity. In the time mean, the CASE reproduces large-scale thermohaline and circulation structures, including observed temperature gradients, shoaling isopycnals, and the locations and magnitudes of the equatorward California Current and poleward California Undercurrent. With respect to the annual cycle, the CASE captures the phase and, to a lesser extent, the magnitude of upper-ocean warming and stratification from late summer to early fall and of isopycnal heave during springtime upwelling. The CASE also realistically captures near-surface diapycnal mixing during upwelling season and the semiannual cycle of the California Undercurrent. In terms of interannual variability, the most pronounced signals are the persistent warming and downwelling anomalies of 2014{\textendash}16 and a positive isopycnal salinity anomaly that peaked with the 2015{\textendash}16 El Niño.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Briggs, Ellen M</author><author>Martz, Todd R</author><author>Talley, Lynne D</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Johnson, Kenneth S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Physical and Biological Drivers of Biogeochemical Tracers Within the Seasonal Sea Ice Zone of the Southern Ocean From Profiling Floats</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>Profiling Float</keyword><keyword>SOCCOM</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>and modeling</keyword><keyword>biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC012846</electronic-resource-num><notes>Briggs, E.

The method is based on a supervised machine learning algorithm known as Random Forest (RF) regression, and provides an estimate for O2 given T, S, location and time information. The method is validated by attempting to reproduce the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) O2 field using synthetic data sampled from SOSE. The RF mapping shows skill in the majority of the domain, but is problematic in eastern boundary regions. Maps of O2 at 150 m derived from observed profiles suggest that SOSE and the World Ocean Atlas 2013 climatology may overestimate annual mean O2 in the SO, both on a global and basin scale. A large regional bias is found east of Argentina, where high O2 values in the Argo based estimate are confined closer to the coast compared to other products. SOSE may also underestimate the annual cycle of O2. Evaluation of the RF based method demonstrates its potential to improve understanding of O2 annual mean fields and variability from sparse O2 measurements. This implies the algorithm will also be effective for mapping other biogeochemical variables (e.g. nutrients and carbon). Furthermore, our RF evaluation results can be used to inform the design of future enhancements to the current array of O2 profiling floats.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chamberlain, Paul</author><author>Talley, Lynne D</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew</author><author>Riser, Stephen</author><author>Speer, Kevin</author><author>Gray, Alison R</author><author>Schwartzman, Armin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observing the ice-covered Weddell Gyre with profiling floats: position uncertainties and correlation statistics</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><issue>ja</issue><keywords><keyword>Air/sea Flux Uncertainty</keyword><keyword>Salinity Uncertainty</keyword><keyword>Temperature Uncertainty</keyword><keyword>Under Ice Floats</keyword><keyword>Weddell Sea Circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2017JC012990</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chamberlain, P., Talley, L.

Common practice is to approximate unknown positions by linearly interpolating latitude-longitude between known positions before and after ice cover, although it has been suggested that some improvement may be obtained by interpolating along contours of planetary-geostrophic potential vorticity. Profiles with linearly interpolated positions represent 16% of the Southern Ocean Argo dataset; consequences arising from this approximation have not been quantified. Using three distinct datasets from the Weddell Gyre - 10 day satellite-tracked Argo floats, daily-tracked RAFOS-enabled floats, and a particle release simulation in the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) - we perform a data withholding experiment to assess position uncertainty in latitude-longitude and potential vorticity coordinates as a function of time since last fix. A spatial correlation analysis using the float data provides temperature and salinity uncertainty estimates as a function of distance error. Combining the spatial correlation scales and the position uncertainty, we estimate uncertainty in temperature and salinity as a function of duration of position loss. Maximum position uncertainty for interpolation during 8 months without position data is 116 {\textpm} 148 km for latitude-longitude and 92 {\textpm} 121 km for potential vorticity coordinates. The estimated maximum uncertainty in local temperature and salinity over the entire 2,000 m profiles during 8 months without position data is 0.66 {\textdegree}~C and 0.15 psu in the upper 300 m and 0.16 {\textdegree}~C and 0.01 psu below 300 m.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Tianyu</author><author>Gille, Sarah T</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Zilberman, Nathalie V</author><author>Du, Yan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Numerical simulations to project Argo float positions in the mid-depth and deep southwest Pacific</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic TechnologyJournal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic TechnologyJournal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><isbn>0739-0572</isbn><notes>Wang, T., Gille, S.

A reliable subtraction of seasonal signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS) position time series is beneficial for the accuracy of derived velocities. In this research, we propose a two-stage solution of the problem of a proper determination of seasonal changes. We employ environmental loading models (atmospheric, hydrological and ocean non-tidal) with a dominant annual signal of amplitudes in their superposition of up to 12 mm and study the seasonal signal (annual and semi-annual) estimates that change over time using improved singular spectrum analysis (ISSA). Then, this deterministic model is subtracted from GPS position time series. We studied data from 376 permanent International GNSS Service (IGS) stations, derived as the official contribution to International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2014) to measure the influence of applying environmental loading models on the estimated vertical velocity. Having removed the environmental loadings directly from the position time series, we noticed the evident change in the power spectrum for frequencies between 4 and 80 cpy. Therefore, we modelled the seasonal signal in environmental models using the ISSA approach and subtracted it from GPS vertical time series to leave the noise character of the time series intact. We estimated the velocity dilution of precision (DP) as a ratio between classical Weighted Least Squares and ISSA approach. For a total number of 298 out of the 376 stations analysed, the DP was lower than 1. This indicates that when the ISSA-derived curve was removed from the GPS data, the error of velocity becomes lower than it was before.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bowman, Kevin W.</author><author>Liu, J</author><author>Bloom, A A</author><author>Parazoo, N C</author><author>Lee, M</author><author>Jiang, Z</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Gierach, M M</author><author>Collatz, G J</author><author>Gurney, K R</author><author>Wunch, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global and Brazilian Carbon Response to El Niño Modoki 2011–2010</title><secondary-title>Earth and Space Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth and Space Science</full-title></periodical><pages>637-660</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>assimilation</keyword><keyword>carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>satellite</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016EA000204</electronic-resource-num><notes>Bowman, K.

In order to understand its impact on carbon cycle variability, we derive the 2011?2010 annual carbon flux change (δF?) globally and specifically to Brazil using the NASA Carbon Monitoring System Flux (CMS-Flux) framework. Satellite observations of CO2, CO, and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) are ingested into a 4D-variational assimilation system driven by carbon cycle models to infer spatially resolved carbon fluxes including net ecosystem production, biomass burning, and gross primary productivity (GPP). The global 2011?2010 net carbon flux change was estimated to be δF?=?1.60 PgC, while the Brazilian carbon flux change was ?0.24 ± 0.11 PgC. This estimate is broadly within the uncertainty of previous aircraft-based estimates restricted to the Amazon basin. The 2011?2010 biomass burning change in Brazil was ?0.24 ± 0.036 PgC, which implies a near-zero 2011?2010 change of the net ecosystem production (NEP): The near-zero NEP change is the result of quantitatively comparable increases GPP (0.31 ± 0.20 PgC) and respiration in 2011. Comparisons between Brazilian and global component carbon flux changes reveal complex interactions between the processes controlling annual land-atmosphere CO2 exchanges. These results show the potential of multiple satellite observations to help quantify and spatially resolve the response of productivity and respiration fluxes to climate variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, Nadya T</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In Search of Fingerprints of the Recent Intensification of the Ocean Water Cycle</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>5513-5528</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0626.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vinogradova, N.

Here changes in the ocean water cycle in the past two decades are examined to evaluate whether the rain-gauge notion can be extended to shorter time scales. Using a novel framework it is demonstrated that there have been persistent changes (defined as significant trends) in both salinity and the ocean water cycle in many ocean regions, including the subtropical gyres in both hemispheres, low latitudes of the tropical Pacific, the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre, and the Arctic Ocean. On average, the ocean water cycle has amplified by approximately 5% since 1993, but strong regional variations exist (as well as dependency on the surface freshwater flux products chosen). Despite an intensified ocean water cycle in the last two decades, changes in surface salinity do not follow expected patterns of amplified salinity contrasts, challenging the perception that if it rains more the seas always get fresher and if it evaporates more the seas always get saltier. These findings imply a time of emergence of anthropogenic hydrological signals shorter in surface freshwater fluxes than in surface salinity and point to the importance of ocean circulation, salt transports, and natural climate variability in shaping patterns of decadal change in surface salinity. Therefore, the use of salinity measurements in conjunction with ocean salt fluxes can provide a more meaningful way of fingerprinting changes in the global water cycle on decadal time scales. </abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ngeve, Magdalene N</author><author>Van der Stocken, Tom</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Koedam, Nico</author><author>Triest, Ludwig</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hidden founders?

Mangrove trees rely on ocean surface currents to spread their hydrochorous propagules through space. Since pollen dispersal is generally restricted to local scales, high level of short-distance propagule dispersal is expected to result in FSGS in Rhizophora spp. We investigated FSGS, recent bottleneck events, as well as historical and contemporary expansion patterns in Rhizophora racemosa populations from the entire coast of Cameroon, using 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Populations of the Cameroon Estuary complex (CEC) showed significant FSGS and significant reduction in effective population sizes (recent bottlenecks), compared to the other areas. Additionally, our results indicate stark differences between historical and contemporary expansion models. These suggest that contemporary processes such as restricted propagule dispersal, bottleneck events from high indirect and direct anthropogenic pressure, and recolonization by founders from ancient local pockets/refugia most plausibly shape the patterns of FSGS in the CEC.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Wei</author><author>Li, Jiancheng</author><author>Ray, Jim</author><author>Cheng, Minkang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved geophysical excitations constrained by polar motion observations and GRACE/SLR time-dependent gravity</title><secondary-title>Geodesy and Geodynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geodesy and Geodynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>377-388</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Atmospheric</keyword><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>Least difference combination</keyword><keyword>Polar motion</keyword><keyword>SLR</keyword><keyword>and hydrological/crospheric excitation</keyword><keyword>oceanic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geog.2017.04.006</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chen, W., J.

Unfortunately, these model outputs are far from perfect and have notable discrepancies with respect to polar motion observations, due to non-uniform distributions of meteorological observatories, as well as theoretical approximations and non-global mass conservation in these models. In this study, the LDC (Least Difference Combination) method is adopted to obtain some improved atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological/crospheric angular momentum (AAM, OAM and HAM/CAM, respectively) functions and excitation functions (termed as the LDCgsm solutions). Various GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and SLR (Satellite Laser Ranging) geopotential data are adopted to correct the non-global mass conservation problem, while polar motion data are used as general constraints. The LDCgsm solutions can reveal not only periodic fluctuations but also secular trends in AAM, OAM and HAM/CAM, and are in better agreement with polar motion observations, reducing the unexplained excitation to the level of about 5.5 mas (standard derivation value; about 1/5–1/4 of those corresponding to the original model outputs).</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, An</author><author>Ocaña, Victor</author><author>Garg, Vikram</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Toole, John</author><author>Krishfield, Richard</author><author>Lee, Craig</author><author>Rainville, Luc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Benefit of Current and Future ALPS Data for Improving Arctic Coupled Ocean-Sea Ice State Estimation</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>69-73</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2017.223</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nguyen, A., Ocaña, V., Garg, V., Heimbach, P., Toole, J., Krishfield, R., … Rainville, L.

The synergy between ALPS-based observations and coupled ocean-sea ice state and parameter estimation as practiced in the Arctic Subpolar gyre sTate Estimate (ASTE) project is illustrated through several examples. In the western Arctic, Ice- Tethered Pro lers have been providing important hydrographic constraints of the water column down to 800 m depth since 2004. ASTE takes advantage of these detailed constraints to infer vertical pro les of diapycnal mixing rates in the central Canada Basin. The state estimation framework is also used to explore the potential utility of Argo-type oats in regions with sparse data coverage, such as the eastern Arctic and the seasonal ice zones. Finally, the framework is applied to identify potential deployment sites that optimize the impact of oat measurements on bulk oceanographic quantities of interest.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Zhang, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global coupled sea ice-ocean state estimation</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>931-956</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>4DVAR</keyword><keyword>Adjoint</keyword><keyword>Assimilation</keyword><keyword>Coupled ocean model</keyword><keyword>ECCO2</keyword><keyword>Sea ice</keyword><keyword>Sea ice concentration data</keyword><keyword>State estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-015-2796-6</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fenty, I., Menemenlis, D., &amp;amp; Zhang, H.

Simulated sea-ice deformation from numerical simulations with 4.5, 9, and 18 km horizontal grid spacing and a viscous–plastic (VP) sea-ice rheology are compared with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite observations (RGPS, RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System) for the time period 1996–2008. All three simulations can reproduce the large-scale ice deformation patterns, but small-scale sea- ice deformations and linear kinematic features (LKFs) are not adequately reproduced. The mean sea-ice total deforma- tion rate is about 40 % lower in all model solutions than in the satellite observations, especially in the seasonal sea-ice zone. A decrease in model grid spacing, however, produces a higher density and more localized ice deformation fea- tures. The 4.5 km simulation produces some linear kinematic features, but not with the right frequency. The dependence on length scale and probability density functions (PDFs) of absolute divergence and shear for all three model solutions show a power-law scaling behavior similar to RGPS obser- vations, contrary to what was found in some previous studies. Overall, the 4.5km simulation produces the most realistic divergence, vorticity, and shear when compared with RGPS data. This study provides an evaluation of high and coarse- resolution viscous–plastic sea-ice simulations based on spa- tial distribution, time series, and power-law scaling metrics.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Savage, Anna C</author><author>Arbic, Brian K</author><author>Alford, Matthew H</author><author>Ansong, Joseph K</author><author>Farrar, J Thomas</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>O'Rourke, Amanda K</author><author>Richman, James G</author><author>Shriver, Jay F</author><author>Voet, Gunnar</author><author>Wallcraft, Alan J</author><author>Zamudio, Luis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spectral decomposition of internal gravity wave sea surface height in global models</title><secondary-title>J.

Frequency-horizontal wavenumber SSH spectral densities are computed over seven regions of the world ocean from two simulations of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and three simulations of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). High wavenumber, high-frequency SSH variance follows the predicted IGW linear dispersion curves. The realism of high-frequency motions (&gt;0:87 cpd) in the models is tested through comparison of the frequency spectral density of dynamic height variance computed from the highest-resolution runs of each model (1/258 HYCOM and 1/488 MITgcm) with dynamic height variance frequency spectral density computed from nine in situ profiling instruments. These high-frequency motions are of particular interest because of their contributions to the small-scale SSH variability that will be observed on a global scale in the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite altimetry mission. The variance at supertidal frequencies can be comparable to the tidal and low-frequency variance for high wavenumbers (length scales smaller than 50 km), especially in the higher-resolution simulations. In the highest-resolution simulations, the high-frequency variance can be greater than the low-frequency variance at these scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vazquez-Cuervo, Jorge</author><author>Torres, Hector S</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Chin, Toshio M</author><author>Armstrong, Edward M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relationship between SST gradients and upwelling off Peru and Chile: model/satellite data analysis</title><secondary-title>Int.

Here we investigate to what extent upwelling intensity can be inferred from sea surface tem- perature (SST) derived from remote sensing. As a first step in validation, a comparison between SST observations is performed, which indicates that the 1 km gridded multi-scale ultra-high-resolu- tion (MUR) SST data set is defining a zone of maximum SST gradi- ents closer to shore than the low-resolution National Centers for Environmental Information 0.25° resolution data set. Two model versions, at nominal resolutions of 2 km and 4 km, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model are analysed. A high-resolution version at 2 km is examined for the period 13 September 2011–23 January 2013, while a 4 km version is examined for 6 March 2011–22 April 2013. MUR shows maxima SST gradients in the range of 0.03 ± 0.02 K km−1 while the model showed higher gradients around 0.05 ± 0.02 K km−1. Based on coherence spectra, the relationship between upwelling rate (as inferred from the vertical velocity) and SST gradient is documented in the model from intraseasonal to annual timescales. It suggests that changes in SST gradient magnitudes are related to changes in the intensity of coastal upwelling off Peru and Chile. Such a relation- ship between SST gradients and vertical velocity would allow for the use of satellite-derived SSTs to monitor the intensity of coastal upwelling from the intraseasonal to annual timescales.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nakayama, Yoshihiro</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Schodlok, Michael P</author><author>Rignot, Eric J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas simulation with optimized ocean, sea ice, and thermodynamic ice shelf model parameters</title><secondary-title>J.

Determined through a Kalman filter and Rauch?Tung?Striebel smoother assimilating position observations, Earth orientation parameters, and local ties, JTRF2014 is a subsecular, time series?based TRF whose origin is at the quasi?instantaneous center of mass (CM) as sensed by SLR and whose scale is determined by the quasi?instantaneous VLBI and SLR scales. The dynamical evolution of the positions accounts for a secular motion term, annual, and semiannual periodic modes. Site?dependent variances based on the analysis of loading displacements induced by mass redistributions of terrestrial fluids have been used to control the extent of random walk adopted in the combination. With differences in the amplitude of the annual signal within the range 0.5?0.8 mm, JTRF2014?derived center of network?to?center of mass (CM?CN) is in remarkable agreement with the geocenter motion obtained via spectral inversion of GNSS, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations and modeled ocean bottom pressure from Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO).

Particular focus is on multi-decadal trends and interannual variability at 26.5°N and 45°N. For four of the six reanalysis products, corresponding reference simulations obtained from the same models and forcing datasets but without the imposition of subsurface data constraints are included for comparison. An emphasis is placed on identifying general characteristics of the reanalysis representation of AMOC relative to their reference simulations without subsurface data constraints. The AMOC as simulated in these two sets are presented in the context of results from the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments phase II (CORE-II) effort, wherein a common interannually varying atmospheric forcing data set was used to force a large and diverse set of global ocean-ice models. Relative to the reference simulations and CORE-II forced model simulations it is shown that (1) the reanalysis products tend to have greater AMOC mean strength and enhanced variance and (2) the reanalysis products are less consistent in their year-to-year AMOC changes. We also find that relative to the reference simulations (but not the CORE-II forced model simulations) the reanalysis products tend to have enhanced multi-decadal trends (from 1975–1995 to 1995–2007) in the mid to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ito, Takamitsu</author><author>Wang, Ou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transit Time Distribution based on the ECCO-JPL Ocean Data Assimilation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Marine Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Marine Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>167</volume><keywords><keyword>CFC-11</keyword><keyword>Ocean Data Assimilation</keyword><keyword>Transit Time Distribution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jmarsys.2016.10.015</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ito, T., and O.

The ECCO-JPL circulation provides overall reliable estimates of the upper ocean ventilation rates suitable for biogeochemical studies. Observed distributions of pCFC-11 in the upper ocean thermocline are well reproduced by the convolution integral of the model-based TTD (mean bias&lt;6%, spatial correlation&gt;0.87) but there are significant regional biases in particular near the base of the thermocline and in the deep water formation regions. The model underestimates the deep pCFC-11 (&gt;2000m) in the North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean. The ratio between the mean and the spread of the age spectrum (Γ/Δ) is close to unity (mean=1.04, median=0.99) in the ventilated thermocline of the Pacific basin but there are significant regional variations of the ratio.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van der Stocken, Tom</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling mangrove propagule dispersal trajectories using high-resolution estimates of ocean surface winds and currents</title><secondary-title>Biotropica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biotropica</full-title></periodical><pages>472-481</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Mozambique Channel</keyword><keyword>Western Indian Ocean</keyword><keyword>connectivity</keyword><keyword>eddy currents</keyword><keyword>long distance dispersal</keyword><keyword>tidal motion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/btp.12440</electronic-resource-num><notes>Van der Stocken, T., &amp;amp; Menemenlis, D.

Quantitating connectivity of mangrove patches is an important conservation concern. Current estimates of connectivity, however, fail to integrate the link between ocean currents at different spatial scales and dispersal trajectories. Here, we use high-resolution estimates of ocean currents and surface winds from meteorological and oceanographic analyses, in conjunction with experimental data on propagule traits (e.g., density, size, and shape) and dispersal vector properties (e.g., strength and direction of water and wind currents). We incorporate these data in a dispersal model to illustrate the potential effect of wind on dispersal trajectories of hydrochorous propagules from different mangrove species. We focus on the Western Indian Ocean, including the Mozambique Channel, which has received much attention because of its reported oceanic complexity, to illustrate the effect of oceanic features such as eddy currents and tides. In spite of the complex pattern of ocean surface currents and winds, some propagules are able to cross the Mozambique Channel. Eddy currents and tides may delay arrival at a suitable site. Experimentally demonstrated differences in wind sensitivity among propagule types were shown to affect the probability of departure and the shape of dispersal trajectories. The model could be used to reconstruct current fluxes of mangrove propagules that may help explain past and current distributions of mangrove forests and assess the potential for natural expansion of these forests.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>San Liang, X</author><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Chen, Shuiming</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Decadal Variability of the Eddy Kinetic Energy in the Kuroshio Extension</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1169-1187</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-16-0201.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Yang, Y., San Liang, X., Qiu, B., &amp;amp; Chen, S.

Using a time-varying energetics diagnostic methodology, namely, the localized multiscale energy and vorticity analysis (MS-EVA), and the MS-EVA-based nonlinear instability theory, this study investigates the physical mechanism responsible for such variations with the state estimate from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), Phase II. For the first time, it is found that the decadal modulation of EKE is mainly controlled by the barotropic instability of the background flow. During the high-EKE state, violent meanderings efficiently induce strong barotropic energy transfer from mean kinetic energy (MKE) to EKE despite the rather weak jet strength. The reverse is true in the low-EKE state. Although the enhanced meander in the high-EKE state also transfers a significant portion of energy from mean available potential energy (MAPE) to eddy available potential energy (EAPE) through baroclinic instability, the EAPE is not efficiently converted to EKE as the two processes are not well correlated at low frequencies revealed in the time-varying energetics. The decadal modulation of barotropic instability is found to be in pace with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation but with a time lag of approximately 2 years.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chevallier, Matthieu</author><author>Smith, Gregory C</author><author>Dupont, Frédéric</author><author>Lemieux, Jean-François</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Hernandez, Fabrice</author><author>Msadek, Rym</author><author>Peterson, K Andrew</author><author>Storto, Andrea</author><author>Toyoda, Takahiro</author><author>Valdivieso, Maria</author><author>Vernieres, Guillaume</author><author>Zuo, Hao</author><author>Balmaseda, Magdalena</author><author>Chang, You-Soon</author><author>Ferry, Nicolas</author><author>Garric, Gilles</author><author>Haines, Keith</author><author>Keeley, Sarah</author><author>Kovach, Robin M</author><author>Kuragano, Tsurane</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Tang, Yongming</author><author>Tsujino, Hiroyuki</author><author>Wang, Xiaochun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intercomparison of the Arctic sea ice cover in global ocean–sea ice reanalyses from the ORA-IP project</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>1107-1136</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-016-2985-y</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chevallier, M., et al.

This is especially true for sea ice volume, as long-term and large scale sea ice thickness observations are inexistent. Results from the Ocean ReAnalyses Intercomparison Project (ORA-IP) are presented, with a focus on Arctic sea ice fields reconstructed by state-of-the-art global ocean reanalyses. Differences between the various reanalyses are explored in terms of the effects of data assimilation, model physics and atmospheric forcing on properties of the sea ice cover, including concentration, thickness, velocity and snow. Amongst the 14 reanalyses studied here, 9 assimilate sea ice concentration, and none assimilate sea ice thickness data. The comparison reveals an overall agreement in the reconstructed concentration fields, mainly because of the constraints in surface temperature imposed by direct assimilation of ocean observations, prescribed or assimilated atmospheric forcing and assimilation of sea ice concentration. However, some spread still exists amongst the reanalyses, due to a variety of factors. In particular, a large spread in sea ice thickness is found within the ensemble of reanalyses, partially caused by the biases inherited from their sea ice model components. Biases are also affected by the assimilation of sea ice concentration and the treatment of sea ice thickness in the data assimilation process. An important outcome of this study is that the spatial distribution of ice volume varies widely between products, with no reanalysis standing out as clearly superior as compared to altimetry estimates. The ice thickness from systems without assimilation of sea ice concentration is not worse than that from systems constrained with sea ice observations. An evaluation of the sea ice velocity fields reveals that ice drifts too fast in most systems. As an ensemble, the ORA-IP reanalyses capture trends in Arctic sea ice area and extent relatively well. However, the ensemble can not be used to get a robust estimate of recent trends in the Arctic sea ice volume. Biases in the reanalyses certainly impact the simulated air–sea fluxes in the polar regions, and questions the suitability of current sea ice reanalyses to initialize seasonal forecasts.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Little, Christopher M</author><author>Buckley, Martha W</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms underlying recent decadal changes in subpolar North Atlantic Ocean heat content</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>7181-7197</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>1616 Climate variability</keyword><keyword>3305 Climate change and variability</keyword><keyword>4513 Decadal ocean variability</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>Atlantic multidecadal variability</keyword><keyword>Sverdrup balance</keyword><keyword>decadal variability</keyword><keyword>heat content</keyword><keyword>ocean state estimation</keyword><keyword>overturning circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC012845</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

In 2004–2005, SPNA decadal upper ocean and sea-surface temperature trends reversed from warming during 1994–2004 to cooling over 2005–2015. This recent decadal trend reversal in SPNA ocean heat content (OHC) is studied using a physically consistent, observationally constrained global ocean state estimate covering 1992–2015. The estimate's physical consistency facilitates quantitative causal attribution of ocean variations. Closed heat budget diagnostics reveal that the SPNA OHC trend reversal is the result of heat advection by midlatitude ocean circulation. Kinematic decompositions reveal that changes in the deep and intermediate vertical overturning circulation cannot account for the trend reversal, but rather ocean heat transports by horizontal gyre circulations render the primary contributions. The shift in horizontal gyre advection reflects anomalous circulation acting on the mean temperature gradients. Maximum covariance analysis (MCA) reveals strong covariation between the anomalous horizontal gyre circulation and variations in the local wind stress curl, suggestive of a Sverdrup response. Results have implications for decadal predictability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rosso, Isabella</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Verdy, Ariane</author><author>Talley, Lynne D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Space and time variability of the Southern Ocean carbon budget</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>7407-7432</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>and modeling</keyword><keyword>carbon budget</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword><keyword>state estimate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012646</electronic-resource-num><notes>Rosso, I., M.

The relative importance of these mechanisms in the Southern Ocean is uncertain, as year-round observations in this area have been limited. We use a novel physical-biogeochemical state estimate of the Southern Ocean to construct a closed DIC budget of the top 650 m and investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the different components of the carbon system. The dominant mechanisms of variability in upper ocean DIC depend on location and time and space scales considered. Advective transport is the most influential mechanism and governs the local DIC budget across the 10 day–5 year timescales analyzed. Diffusive effects are nearly negligible. The large-scale transport structure is primarily set by upwelling and downwelling, though both the lateral ageostrophic and geostrophic transports are significant. In the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the carbon budget components are also influenced by the presence of topography and biological hot spots. In the subtropics, evaporation and air-sea CO2 flux primarily balances the sink due to biological production and advective transport. Finally, in the subpolar region sea ice processes, which change the seawater volume and thus the DIC concentration, compensate the large impact of the advective transport and modulate the timing of biological activity and air-sea CO2 flux.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Xinfeng</author><author>Spall, Michael</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Ocean Vertical Velocity From a Dynamically Consistent Ocean State Estimate</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>8208-8224</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>4220 Coral reef systems</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4279 Upwelling and convergences</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>ocean state estimate</keyword><keyword>vertical exchange</keyword><keyword>vertical transport</keyword><keyword>vertical velocity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC012985</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liang, X., M.

Conventional patterns of vertical velocity, Ekman pumping, appear in the upper ocean, with topographic dominance at depth. Intense and vertically coherent upwelling and downwelling occur in the Southern Ocean, which are likely due to the interaction of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and large-scale topographic features and are generally canceled out in the conventional zonally averaged results. These “elevators” at high latitudes connect the upper to the deep and abyssal oceans and working together with isopycnal mixing are likely a mechanism, in addition to the formation of deep and abyssal waters, for fast responses of the deep and abyssal oceans to the changing climate. Also, Eulerian and parameterized eddy-induced components are of opposite signs in numerous regions around the global ocean, particularly in the ocean interior away from surface and bottom. Nevertheless, residual vertical velocity is primarily determined by the Eulerian component, and related to winds and large-scale topographic features. The current estimates of vertical velocities can serve as a useful reference for investigating the vertical exchange of ocean properties and tracers, and its complex spatial structure ultimately permits regional tests of basic oceanographic concepts such as Sverdrup balance and coastal upwelling/downwelling.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, James</author><author>Vinogradova, Nadya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Causes of accelerating sea level on the East Coast of North America</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>44</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017GL072845</electronic-resource-num><notes>Davis, J., and N.

The estimated post-1990 accelerations range from near zero to ∼0.3 mm yr-2. We find that the observed sea level acceleration is well modeled using several processes: mass change in Greenland and Antarctica as measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites; ocean dynamic and steric variability provided by the GECCO2 ocean synthesis; and the inverted barometer effect. However, to achieve this fit requires estimation of an admittance for the dynamical and steric contribution, possibly due to the coarse resolution of this analysis or to simplifications associated with parameterization of bottom friction in the shallow coastal areas. The acceleration from ice loss alone is equivalent to a regional sea level rise in one century of 0.2 m in the north and 0.75 m in the south of this region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qiu, Bo</author><author>Chen, Shuiming</author><author>Schneider, Niklas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamical Links between the Decadal Variability of the Oyashio and Kuroshio Extensions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>9591-9605</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Advection</keyword><keyword>Atmosphere-ocean interaction</keyword><keyword>Boundary currents</keyword><keyword>Decadal variability</keyword><keyword>Fronts</keyword><keyword>Oceanic variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jcli-d-17-0397.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Qiu, B., Chen, S., &amp;amp; Schneider, N.

With a mean latitude along 40°N, the western OE front exists primarily west of 153°E and is a continuation of the subarctic gyre western boundary current. The eastern OE front, also appearing along 40°N, is located between 153° and 170°E, whose entity is disconnected from its western counterpart. During 1982–2016, both of the OE fronts exhibit prominent decadal fluctuations, although their signals show little contemporaneous correlation. An upper-ocean temperature budget analysis based on the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, phase II (ECCO2), state estimate reveals that the advective temperature flux convergence plays a critical role in determining the low-frequency temperature changes relating to the OE fronts. Specifically, the western OE front variability is controlled by the decadal mesoscale eddy modulations in the upstream Kuroshio Extension (KE). An enhanced eddy activity increases the poleward heat transport and works to strengthen the western OE front. The eastern OE front variability, on the other hand, is dictated by both the meridional shift of the KE position and the circulation intensity change immediately north of the eastern OE. Different baroclinic adjustment speeds for the KE and OE are found to cause the in-phase changes between these latter two processes. Lack of contemporaneous correlation between the decadal western and eastern OE variability is found to be related to the interaction of the meridionally migrating KE jet with the Shatsky Rise near 159°E.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Evans, Dafydd Gwyn</author><author>Toole, John</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Zika, Jan D</author><author>Garabato, Alberto C Naveira</author><author>Nurser, A J George</author><author>Yu, Lisan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recent Wind-Driven Variability in Atlantic Water Mass Distribution and Meridional Overturning Circulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>633-647</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Atmosphere-ocean interaction</keyword><keyword>Ekman pumping/transport</keyword><keyword>Inverse methods</keyword><keyword>North Atlantic Ocean</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Water masses</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-16-0089.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Evans, D.

The relative roles of diabatic and adiabatic processes in the volume and heat budgets of the subtropical gyre are investigated by projecting data into temperature coordinates as volumes of water using an Argo-based climatology and an ocean state estimate (ECCO version 4). This highlights that variations in the subtropical gyre volume budget are predominantly set by transport divergence in the gyre. A strong correlation between the volume anomaly due to transport divergence and the variability of both thermocline depth and Ekman pumping over the gyre suggests that wind-driven heave drives transport anomalies at the gyre boundaries. This wind-driven heaving contributes significantly to variations in the heat content of the gyre, as do anomalies in the air–sea fluxes. The analysis presented suggests that wind forcing plays an important role in driving interannual variability in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and that this variability can be unraveled from spatially distributed hydrographic observations using the framework presented here.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Verdy, A</author><author>Mazloff, M R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A data assimilating model for estimating Southern Ocean biogeochemistry</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>6968-6988</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>0414 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>and modeling</keyword><keyword>biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012650</electronic-resource-num><notes>Verdy, A., and M.

The state estimate is constrained with observations while maintaining closed budgets and obeying dynamical and thermodynamic balances. Observations from profiling floats, shipboard data, underway measurements, and satellites are used for assimilation. The years 2008–2012 are chosen due to the relative abundance of oxygen observations from Argo floats during this time. The skill of the state estimate at fitting the data is assessed. The agreement is best for fields that are constrained with the most observations, such as surface pCO2 in Drake Passage (44% of the variance captured) and oxygen profiles (over 60% of the variance captured at 200 and 1000 m). The validity of adjoint method optimization for coupled physical-biogeochemical state estimation is demonstrated with a series of gradient check experiments. The method is shown to be mature and ready to synthesize in situ biogeochemical observations as they become more available. Documenting the B-SOSE configuration and diagnosing the strengths and weaknesses of the solution informs usage of this product as both a climate baseline and as a way to test hypotheses. Transport of Intermediate Waters across 32°S supplies significant amounts of nitrate to the Atlantic Ocean (5.57 ± 2.94 Tmol yr−1) and Indian Ocean (5.09 ± 3.06 Tmol yr−1), but much less nitrate reaches the Pacific Ocean (1.78 ± 1.91 Tmol yr−1). Estimates of air-sea carbon dioxide fluxes south of 50°S suggest a mean uptake of 0.18 Pg C/yr for the time period analyzed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Storto, Andrea</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Balmaseda, Magdalena</author><author>Guinehut, Stéphanie</author><author>Xue, Yan</author><author>Szekely, Tanguy</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Chang, You-Soon</author><author>Good, Simon A</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Vernieres, Guillaume</author><author>Ferry, Nicolas</author><author>Peterson, K Andrew</author><author>Behringer, David</author><author>Ishii, Masayoshi</author><author>Masuda, Shuhei</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Toyoda, Takahiro</author><author>Yin, Yonghong</author><author>Valdivieso, Maria</author><author>Barnier, Bernard</author><author>Boyer, Tim</author><author>Lee, Tony</author><author>Gourrion, Jérome</author><author>Wang, Ou</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Rosati, Anthony</author><author>Kovach, Robin</author><author>Hernandez, Fabrice</author><author>Martin, Matthew J</author><author>Kamachi, Masafumi</author><author>Kuragano, Tsurane</author><author>Mogensen, Kristian</author><author>Alves, Oscar</author><author>Haines, Keith</author><author>Wang, Xiaochun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Steric sea level variability (1993–2010) in an ensemble of ocean reanalyses and objective analyses</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>709-729</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-015-2554-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>Storto, A., et al.

In this work, as part of the Ocean Reanalysis Intercomparison Project, the global and regional steric sea level changes are estimated and compared from an ensemble of 16 ocean reanalyses and 4 objective analyses. These estimates are initially compared with a satellite-derived (altimetry minus gravimetry) dataset for a short period (2003–2010). The ensemble mean exhibits a significant high correlation at both global and regional scale, and the ensemble of ocean reanalyses outperforms that of objective analyses, in particular in the Southern Ocean. The reanalysis ensemble mean thus represents a valuable tool for further analyses, although large uncertainties remain for the inter-annual trends. Within the extended intercomparison period that spans the altimetry era (1993–2010), we find that the ensemble of reanalyses and objective analyses are in good agreement, and both detect a trend of the global steric sea level of 1.0 and 1.1 ± 0.05 mm/year, respectively. However, the spread among the products of the halosteric component trend exceeds the mean trend itself, questioning the reliability of its estimate. This is related to the scarcity of salinity observations before the Argo era. Furthermore, the impact of deep ocean layers is non-negligible on the steric sea level variability (22 and 12 % for the layers below 700 and 1500 m of depth, respectively), although the small deep ocean trends are not significant with respect to the products spread.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Toyoda, Takahiro</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Kuragano, Tsurane</author><author>Kosugi, Naohiro</author><author>Sasano, Daisuke</author><author>Kamachi, Masafumi</author><author>Ishikawa, Yoichi</author><author>Masuda, Shuhei</author><author>Sato, Kanako</author><author>Awaji, Toshiyuki</author><author>Hernandez, Fabrice</author><author>Ferry, Nicolas</author><author>Guinehut, Stéphanie</author><author>Martin, Matthew</author><author>Andrew Peterson, K</author><author>Good, Simon A</author><author>Valdivieso, Maria</author><author>Haines, Keith</author><author>Storto, Andrea</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Yin, Yonghong</author><author>Shi, Li</author><author>Alves, Oscar</author><author>Smith, Gregory</author><author>Chang, You-Soon</author><author>Vernieres, Guillaume</author><author>Wang, Xiaochun</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Wang, Ou</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Zuo, Hao</author><author>Balmaseda, Magdalena</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual-decadal variability of wintertime mixed layer depths in the North Pacific detected by an ensemble of ocean syntheses</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>891-907</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-015-2762-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Toyoda, T., et al.

The first leading EOF mode represents the interannual MLD anomalies centered in the eastern part of the central mode water formation region in phase opposition with those in the eastern subtropics and the central Alaskan Gyre. This first EOF mode is highly correlated with the Pacific decadal oscillation index on both the interannual and decadal time scales. The second leading EOF mode represents the MLD variability in the subtropical mode water (STMW) formation region and has a good correlation with the wintertime West Pacific (WP) index with time lag of 3 years, suggesting the importance of the oceanic dynamical response to the change in the surface wind field associated with the meridional shifts of the Aleutian Low. The above MLD variabilities are in basic agreement with previous observational and modeling findings. Moreover the reanalysis ensemble provides uncertainty estimates. The interannual MLD anomalies in the first and second EOF modes are consistently represented by the individual reanalyses and the amplitudes of the variabilities generally exceed the ensemble spread of the reanalyses. Besides, the resulting MLD variability indices, spanning the 1948–2012 period, should be helpful for characterizing the North Pacific climate variability. In particular, a 6-year oscillation including the WP teleconnection pattern in the atmosphere and the oceanic MLD variability in the STMW formation region is first detected.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Quran</author><author>Zhang, Xuebin</author><author>Church, John A</author><author>Hu, Jianyu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability and change of sea level and its components in the Indo-Pacific region during the altimetry era</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>1862-1881</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>1641 Sea level change</keyword><keyword>4513 Decadal ocean variability</keyword><keyword>4522 ENSO</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>interannual and decadal variability</keyword><keyword>linear trend</keyword><keyword>mass-induced sea level</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword><keyword>steric sea level</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012345</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wu, Q., X.

A better understanding of those low-frequency sea level variations benefits the detection and attribution of climate change signals. Nonetheless, the contributions of thermosteric, halosteric, and mass sea level components to sea level variability and trend patterns remain unclear. By focusing on signals associated with dominant climate modes in the Indo-Pacific region, we estimate the interannual and decadal fingerprints and trend of each sea level component utilizing a multivariate linear regression of two adjoint-based ocean reanalyses. Sea level interannual, decadal, and trend patterns primarily come from thermosteric sea level (TSSL). Halosteric sea level (HSSL) is of regional importance in the Pacific Ocean on decadal time scale and dominates sea level trends in the northeast subtropical Pacific. The compensation between TSSL and HSSL is identified in their decadal variability and trends. The interannual and decadal variability of temperature generally peak at subsurface around 100 m but that of salinity tend to be surface-intensified. Decadal temperature and salinity signals extend deeper into the ocean in some regions than their interannual equivalents. Mass sea level (MassSL) is critical for the interannual and decadal variability of sea level over shelf seas. Inconsistencies exist in MassSL trend patterns among various estimates. This study highlights regions where multiple processes work together to control sea level variability and change. Further work is required to better understand the interaction of different processes in those regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Xinfeng</author><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Change of the Global Ocean Vertical Heat Transport over 1993–2010</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>5319-5327</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate variability</keyword><keyword>Data assimilation</keyword><keyword>Decadal variability</keyword><keyword>Mixing</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jcli-d-16-0569.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liang, X., C.

Many patterns of change are consistent with prior studies. However, at various levels above 1800 m the global integral of the change in ocean vertical heat flux involves the summation of positive and negative regional contributions and is not statistically significant. The nonsignificance of change in the global ocean vertical heat transport from an ocean state estimate that provides global coverage and regular sampling, spatially and temporally, raises the question of whether an adequate observational database exists to assess changes in the upper ocean heat content over the past few decades. Also, whereas the advective term largely determines the spatial pattern of the change in ocean vertical heat flux, its global integral is not significantly different from zero. In contrast, the diffusive term, although regionally weak except in high-latitude oceans, produces a statistically significant extra downward heat flux during the 2000s. This result suggests that besides ocean advection, ocean mixing processes, including isopycnal and diapycnal as well as convective mixing, are important for the decadal variation of the heat exchange between upper and deep oceans as well. Furthermore, the analyses herein indicate that focusing on any particular region in explaining changes of the global ocean heat content is misleading.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, Nat</author><author>Straneo, Fiammetta</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Satellite-derived submarine melt rates and mass balance (2011–2015) for Greenland’s largest remaining ice tongues</title><secondary-title>The Cryosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cryosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>2773-2782</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/tc-11-2773-2017</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wilson, N., F.

While submarine melting is recog- nized as a major contributor to mass loss, the spatial distri- bution of submarine melting and its contribution to the to- tal mass balance of these floating extensions is incompletely known and understood. Here, we use high-resolution World- View satellite imagery collected between 2011 and 2015 to infer the magnitude and spatial variability of melt rates un- der Greenland’s largest remaining ice tongues – Nioghalvf- jerdsbræ (79 North Glacier, 79N), Ryder Glacier (RG), and Petermann Glacier (PG). Submarine melt rates under the ice tongues vary considerably, exceeding 50ma−1 near the grounding zone and decaying rapidly downstream. Channels, likely originating from upstream subglacial channels, give rise to large melt variations across the ice tongues. We com- pare the total melt rates to the influx of ice to the ice tongue to assess their contribution to the current mass balance. At Petermann Glacier and Ryder Glacier, we find that the com- bined submarine and aerial melt approximately balances the ice flux from the grounded ice sheet. At Nioghalvfjerdsbræ the total melt flux (14.2 ± 0.96 km3 a−1 w.e., water equiva- lent) exceeds the inflow of ice (10.2 ± 0.59 km3 a−1 w.e.), in- dicating present thinning of the ice tongue.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melzer, B A</author><author>Subrahmanyam, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of GRACE Mascon Gravity Solution in Relation to Interannual Oceanic Water Mass Variations</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>907-914</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>AD 2003 to 2014</keyword><keyword>Altimetry</keyword><keyword>Argo floats data</keyword><keyword>GECCO2</keyword><keyword>GRACE mascon gravity solution</keyword><keyword>GRACE satellite mascon data set</keyword><keyword>Gravity</keyword><keyword>Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment</keyword><keyword>Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)</keyword><keyword>Harmonic analysis</keyword><keyword>Market research</keyword><keyword>Salinity (geophysical)</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword><keyword>Sea level</keyword><keyword>accelerated water cycle</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>gravity anomaly</keyword><keyword>height measurement</keyword><keyword>interannual oceanic water mass variation</keyword><keyword>mascon cell</keyword><keyword>multimission altimetry</keyword><keyword>ocean mass</keyword><keyword>oceanic freshwater budget study</keyword><keyword>precipitation pattern</keyword><keyword>remote sensing</keyword><keyword>salinity (geophysical)</keyword><keyword>salinity measurements</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword><keyword>sea surface height</keyword><keyword>spatial interannual evaporation variability</keyword><keyword>steric sea level</keyword><keyword>water cycle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TGRS.2016.2616760</electronic-resource-num><notes>Melzer, B.

Compared with the reference MLDs calculated from individual profiles, MLDs calculated from monthly mean and gridded profiles show negative biases of 10–20 m in early spring related to the re-stratification process of relatively deep mixed layers. Vertical resolution of profiles also influences the MLD estimation. MLDs are underestimated by approximately 5–7 (14–16) m with the vertical resolution of 25 (50) m when the criterion of potential density exceeding the 10-m value by 0.03 kg m−3 is used for the MLD estimation. Using the larger criterion (0.125 kg m−3) generally reduces the underestimations. In addition, positive biases greater than 100 m are found in wintertime subpolar regions when MLD criteria based on temperature are used. Biases of the reanalyses are due to both model errors and errors related to differences between the assimilation methods. The result shows that these errors are partially cancelled out through the ensemble averaging. Moreover, the bias in the ensemble mean field of the reanalyses is smaller than in the observation-only analyses. This is largely attributed to comparably higher resolutions of the reanalyses. The robust reproduction of both the seasonal cycle and interannual variability by the ensemble mean of the reanalyses indicates a great potential of the ensemble mean MLD field for investigating and monitoring upper ocean processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Wei</author><author>Xie, Shang-Ping</author><author>Liu, Zhengyu</author><author>Zhu, Jiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Overlooked possibility of a collapsed Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in warming climate</title><secondary-title>Science Advances</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science Advances</full-title></periodical><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><notes>Liu, W., Xie, S.-P., Liu, Z., &amp;amp; Zhu, J.

This intermodel consensus may be an artifact of common model biases that favor a stable AMOC. Observationally based freshwater budget analyses suggest that the AMOC is in an unstable regime susceptible for large changes in response to perturbations. By correcting the model biases, we show that the AMOC collapses 300 years after the atmospheric CO2 concentration is abruptly doubled from the 1990 level. Compared to an uncorrected model, the AMOC collapse brings about large, markedly different climate responses: a prominent cooling over the northern North Atlantic and neighboring areas, sea ice increases over the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian seas and to the south of Greenland, and a significant southward rain-belt migration over the tropical Atlantic. Our results highlight the need to develop dynamical metrics to constrain models and the importance of reducing model biases in long-term climate projection.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clayton, Sophie</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Jahn, Oliver</author><author>Hill, Christopher</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biogeochemical versus ecological consequences of modeled ocean physics</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2877-2889</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-14-2877-2017</electronic-resource-num><notes>Clayton, S., Dutkiewicz, S., Jahn, O., Hill, C., Heimbach, P., &amp;amp; Follows, M.

We present a systematic study of the differences generated by coupling the same ecological–biogeochemical model to a 1°, coarse-resolution, and 1∕6°, eddy-permitting, global ocean circulation model to (a) biogeochemistry (e.g., primary production) and (b) phytoplankton community structure. Surprisingly, we find that the modeled phytoplankton community is largely unchanged, with the same phenotypes dominating in both cases. Conversely, there are large regional and seasonal variations in primary production, phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass. In the subtropics, mixed layer depths (MLDs) are, on average, deeper in the eddy-permitting model, resulting in higher nutrient supply driving increases in primary production and phytoplankton biomass. In the higher latitudes, differences in winter mixed layer depths, the timing of the onset of the spring bloom and vertical nutrient supply result in lower primary production in the eddy-permitting model. Counterintuitively, this does not drive a decrease in phytoplankton biomass but results in lower zooplankton biomass. We explain these similarities and differences in the model using the framework of resource competition theory, and find that they are the consequence of changes in the regional and seasonal nutrient supply and light environment, mediated by differences in the modeled mixed layer depths. Although previous work has suggested that complex models may respond chaotically and unpredictably to changes in forcing, we find that our model responds in a predictable way to different ocean circulation forcing, despite its complexity. The use of frameworks, such as resource competition theory, provides a tractable way to explore the differences and similarities that occur. As this model has many similarities to other widely used biogeochemical models that also resolve multiple phytoplankton phenotypes, this study provides important insights into how the results of running these models under different physical conditions might be more easily understood.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyssignac, B</author><author>Piecuch, C G</author><author>Merchant, C J</author><author>Racault, M.-F.</author><author>Palanisamy, H</author><author>MacIntosh, C</author><author>Sathyendranath, S</author><author>Brewin, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Causes of the Regional Variability in Observed Sea Level, Sea Surface Temperature and Ocean Colour Over the Period 1993–2011</title><secondary-title>Surveys in Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surveys in Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-29</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10712-016-9383-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Meyssignac, B., Piecuch, C.

The analysis focuses on the signature of the ocean large-scale climate fluctuations driven by the atmospheric forcing and do not address the mesoscale variability. We use the ECCO version 4 ocean reanalysis to unravel the role of ocean transport and surface buoyancy fluxes in the observed SSH, SST and OC variability. We show that the SSH regional variability is dominated by the steric effect (except at high latitude) and is mainly shaped by ocean heat transport divergences with some contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing that can be significant regionally (confirming earlier results). This is in contrast with the SST regional variability, which is the result of the compensation of surface heat fluxes by ocean heat transport in the mixed layer and arises from small departures around this background balance. Bringing together the results of SSH and SST analyses, we show that SSH and SST bear some common variability. This is because both SSH and SST variability show significant contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing. It is evidenced by the high correlation between SST and buoyancy-forced SSH almost everywhere in the ocean except at high latitude. OC, which is determined by phytoplankton biomass, is governed by the availability of light and nutrients that essentially depend on climate fluctuations. For this reason, OC shows significant correlation with SST and SSH. We show that the correlation with SST displays the same pattern as the correlation with SSH with a negative correlation in the tropics and subtropics and a positive correlation at high latitude. We discuss the reasons for this pattern.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chin, Toshio Michael</author><author>Vazquez-Cuervo, Jorge</author><author>Armstrong, Edward M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A multi-scale high-resolution analysis of global sea surface temperature</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>154-169</pages><volume>200</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2017.07.029</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chin, T.

In ice-covered regions it is challenging to determine constituent budgets – for heat and momentum, but also for biologically and climatically active gases like carbon dioxide and methane. The harsh environment and relative data scarcity make it difficult to characterize even the physical properties of the ocean surface. Here, we sought to evaluate if numerical model output helps us to better estimate the physical forcing that drives the air–sea gas exchange rate (k) in sea ice zones. We used the budget of radioactive 222Rn in the mixed layer to illustrate the effect that sea ice forcing has on gas budgets and air–sea gas exchange. Appropriate constraint of the 222Rn budget requires estimates of sea ice velocity, concentration, mixed-layer depth, and water velocities, as well as their evolution in time and space along the Lagrangian drift track of a mixed-layer water parcel. We used 36, 9 and 2km horizontal resolution of regional Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) configuration with fine vertical spacing to evaluate the capability of the model to reproduce these parameters. We then compared the model results to existing field data including satellite, moorings and ice-tethered profilers. We found that mode sea ice coverage agrees with satellite-derived observation 88 to 98% of the time when averaged over the Beaufort Gyre, and model sea ice speeds have 82% correlation with observations. The model demonstrated the capacity to capture the broad trends in the mixed layer, although with a significant bias. Model water velocities showed only 29% correlation with point-wise in situ data. This correlation remained low in all three model resolution simulations and we argued that is largely due to the quality of the input atmospheric forcing. Overall, we found that even the coarse-resolution model can make a modest contribution to gas exchange parameterization, by resolving the time variation of parameters that drive the 222Rn budget, including rate of mixed-layer change and sea ice forcings.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Gaillard, Fabienne</author><author>Terre, Thierry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acoustic Tomography in the Canary Basin: Meddies and Tides</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>8983-9003</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017JC013356</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dushaw, B.

The Southern Ocean accounts for 40% of oceanic CO2 uptake, but the estimates are bound by large uncertainties due to a paucity in observations. Gap-filling empirical methods have been used to good effect to approximate pCO2 from satellite observable variables in other parts of the ocean, but many of these methods are not in agreement in the Southern Ocean. In this study we propose two additional methods that perform well in the Southern Ocean: support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR). The methods are used to estimate ΔpCO2 in the Southern Ocean based on SOCAT v3, achieving similar trends to the SOM-FFN method by Landschützer et al. (2014). Results show that the SOM-FFN and RFR approaches have RMSEs of similar magnitude (14.84 and 16.45µatm, where 1atm = 101325Pa) where the SVR method has a larger RMSE (24.40µatm). However, the larger errors for SVR and RFR are, in part, due to an increase in coastal observations from SOCAT v2 to v3, where the SOM-FFN method used v2 data. The success of both SOM-FFN and RFR depends on the ability to adapt to different modes of variability. The SOM-FFN achieves this by having independent regression models for each cluster, while this flexibility is intrinsic to the RFR method. Analyses of the estimates shows that the SVR and RFR's respective sensitivity and robustness to outliers define the outcome significantly. Further analyses on the methods were performed by using a synthetic dataset to assess the following: which method (RFR or SVR) has the best performance? What is the effect of using time, latitude and longitude as proxy variables on ΔpCO2? What is the impact of the sampling bias in the SOCAT v3 dataset on the estimates? We find that while RFR is indeed better than SVR, the ensemble of the two methods outperforms either one, due to complementary strengths and weaknesses of the methods. Results also show that for the RFR and SVR implementations, it is better to include coordinates as proxy variables as RMSE scores are lowered and the phasing of the seasonal cycle is more accurate. Lastly, we show that there is only a weak bias due to undersampling. The synthetic data provide a useful framework to test methods in regions of sparse data coverage and show potential as a useful tool to evaluate methods in future studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Lee, Sang-Ki</author><author>Landerer, Felix W.</author><author>Lumpkin, Rick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decade-long deep-ocean warming detected in the subtropical South Pacific</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>927-936</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016GL071661</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

Open ocean deep convection is a common source of error in the representation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation in ocean general circulation models. Although those events are well described in non-assimilatory ocean simulations, the recent appearance of a massive open ocean polynya in the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Phase II reanalysis product (ECCO2) raises questions on which mechanisms are responsible for those spurious events and whether they are also present in other state-of-the-art assimilatory reanalysis products. To investigate this issue, we evaluate how three recently released high-resolution ocean reanalysis products form AABW in their simulations. We found that two of the products create AABW by open ocean deep convection events in the Weddell Sea that are triggered by the interaction of sea ice with the Warm Deep Water, which shows that the assimilation of sea ice is not enough to avoid the appearance of open ocean polynyas. The third reanalysis, My Ocean University Reading UR025.4, creates AABW using a rather dynamically accurate mechanism. The UR025.4 product depicts both continental shelf convection and the export of Dense Shelf Water to the open ocean. Although the accuracy of the AABW formation in this reanalysis product represents an advancement in the representation of the Southern Ocean dynamics, the differences between the real and simulated processes suggest that substantial improvements in the ocean reanalysis products are still needed to accurately represent AABW formation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Yang</author><author>Wang, Zhaomin</author><author>Liu, Chengyan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the response of the Lorenz energy cycle for the Southern Ocean to intensified westerlies</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>2465-2493</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012539</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wu, Y., Wang, Z., &amp;amp; Liu, C.

SSH is a complicated man- ifestation of many oceanic processes, and, as such, exhibits variability over a wide range of space and time scales. It is well known that tides are of first order impor- tance in SSH, but SSH contributions outside of this narrow band are also of great interest. Satellite altimetry has become an invaluable tool in the study of the global ocean. However, the long repeat period (of order ten to 40 days) of altimeters implies that high-frequency motions will be aliased in altimeter records. In order to study the lower-frequency SSH variability, the aliased high-frequency variability must first be accurately removed. Some of these high-frequency motions, such as the stationary component of surface and internal tides, can be adequately removed even from aliased records, via harmonic analysis or response methods, as long as the signal-to-noise ra- tio is relatively high. However, the challenge of removing SSH signals associated with motions that are less predictable, for instance, the non-stationary component of the internal tides, or the internal gravy wave (IGW) continuum, is much greater. To quantify the magnitude of this challenge, high resolution global general circulation ocean models are used to simulate and study internal tides, the IGW continuum, and other contributions to sea surface variability. Using these models, we examine the space- and time-scales of SSH variability. For instance, we compute frequency- horizontal wavenumber (ω − K) spectral densities over a several oceanic regions that collectively represent different regimes of global ocean variability. These ω − K spec- tral densities show high energy along lines representing the linear dispersion relations predicted by the Sturm-Liouville problem for internal waves. In many oceanic re- gions, the high-frequency motions dominate the small-scale (high-wavenumber) SSH spectra. This has implications for upcoming wide-swath satellite altimeter missions, which will focus on high-wavenumber SSH spectra. In addition to quantifying the frequency-horizontal wavenumber spectral densities, we estimate the SSH variance in subtidal, tidal, and supertidal phenomena through the use of frequency spectral densities. This temporally driven approach allows us to create global maps of SSH variance in these frequency bands. The global band-integrated maps are further di- vided into steric and non-steric SSH components, which further helps to delineate different classes of oceanic motions. These global band-integrated maps provide both results consistent with previous studies (e.g., of subtidal steric SSH, dominated by mesoscale eddies and well-measured by current generation satellite altimeters), as well as unprecedented global maps of the non-stationary component of the internal tides and of the IGW continuum. As global general circulation ocean models have only begun to be able to partially resolve the IGW continuum, we believe that our estimate represents a lower bound of variance in the IGW continuum, and will likely increase with increased horizontal and vertical resolution of ocean models. Indeed, comparisons of the models used here with in-situ data strongly suggest that the mod- els used here underestimate the IGW continuum, while representing other motions with a higher accuracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schwedes, Tobias</author><author>Ham, David A.</author><author>Funke, Simon W.</author><author>Piggott, Matthew D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Introduction to PDE-constrained optimisation</title><secondary-title>Mesh Dependence in PDE-Constrained Optimisation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mesh Dependence in PDE-Constrained Optimisation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-52</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>Cham</pub-location><publisher>Springer International Publishing</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-59483-5_1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schwedes, T., Ham, D.

Turbidity currents are one of the main drivers of sediment transport from the continental shelf to the deep ocean. The resulting sediment deposits can reach hundreds of kilometres into the ocean. Computer models that simulate turbidity currents and the resulting sediment deposit can help us to understand their general behaviour. However, in order to recreate real-world scenarios, the challenge is to find the turbidity current parameters that reproduce the observations of sediment deposits. This paper demonstrates a solution to the inverse sediment transportation problem: for a known sedimentary deposit, the developed model reconstructs details about the turbidity current that produced the deposit. The reconstruction is constrained here by a shallow water sediment-laden density current model, which is discretised by the finite-element method and an adaptive time-stepping scheme. The model is differentiated using the adjoint approach, and an efficient gradient-based optimisation method is applied to identify the turbidity parameters which minimise the misfit between the modelled and the observed field sediment deposits. The capabilities of this approach are demonstrated using measurements taken in the Miocene Marnoso-arenacea Formation (Italy). We find that whilst the model cannot match the deposit exactly due to limitations in the physical processes simulated, it provides valuable insights into the depositional processes and represents a significant advance in our toolset for interpreting turbidity current deposits.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stepanov, Vladimir Nikolaevich</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Atlantic meridional heat and volume transports from ocean models and observations</title><secondary-title>Works of Hydrometeorological Research Center of the Russian Federation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Works of Hydrometeorological Research Center of the Russian Federation</full-title></periodical><pages>104-130</pages><issue>364</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><notes>Stepanov, V.

The global conversion rate of internal lee waves generated by geostrophic flows, the baroclinic tide generated by the barotropic tide over sinusoidal topography and the energy budgets of internal waves at the Luzon ridge calculated from both two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations are investigated in this paper. It is aimed to give us a better understanding of the role of tides and geostrophic flows in ocean dynamics. This paper consists of four parts. Firstly, the conversion rate of internal lee waves generated by geostrophic flows is calculated based on linear theory. In order to get a more precise value, we use two methods to deal with the topographic spectrum. The single beam sounding depth data, global predicted abyssal hill rms heights, WOCE hydrographic atlas, velocity data from SODA and ECCO2, mean flow and eddy velocity from the global eddy-permitting STORM model in a 1° × 1° grid are used for the calculations. By using these data, we can not only compare with the results from different velocity and topography databases, but also get the difference between the conversion rate from the eddies and from the mean flow. The results show that the conversion rates calculated using SODA, ECCO2, mean flow and eddy velocity from the global eddy-permitting STORM model are between 0.03 and 0.23 TW, and the difference between the conversion rate from the eddies and from the mean flow is between 0.05 and 0.11 TW. Secondly, a series of experiments are set up to investigate the baroclinic tide generated by barotropic tide over sinusoidal topography. The baroclinic velocity fields generated are quite different between in subcritical cases and in supercritical cases. The effects of the height of the topography, the amplitude of the barotropic tidal velocity, the stratification and the width of the topography on the baroclinic tide generated are studied in this chapter. The results show that the energy flux is almost proportional to the square of the height of the topography and the square of the amplitude of the barotropic tide; the energy flux will be larger when the width of topography is smaller and the stratification is stronger; there is almost no energy flux generated in experiments with too weak stratification or too wide topogaphy. The results predicted by the linear theory agree well with the results calculated by C1 (energy flux) in most cases, and the results calculated by C2 (conversion rate) are larger than the results calculated by C1 in most cases (the definitions of C1 and C2 could be found in Chapter 3). Thirdly, two-dimensional MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm) is used to simulate internal waves at the Luzon ridge. Here, the topography is represented by two ideal Gaussian hills. The baroclinic energy budget of internal waves is studied and the conversion rate is mainly balanced by the energy flux. The effects of the height of the west ridge, the distance between the two ridges and the amplitude of the barotropic tide on the energy flux and conversion rate are also investigated. It is found that as the height of the west ridge increases, the westward energy flux increases; the internal tides can be enhanced due to a suitable distance between the two ridges; the amplitude of the barotropic tide is one of the crucial factors to determine whether the internal solitary waves would be generated or not, furthermore, when the amplitude of the barotropic tide is larger, the speed of the internal solitary waves generated will be larger. Finally, three-dimensional simulations of internal tides at the Luzon ridge are shown. The MITgcm is used to study the M2 and K1 internal tides and the data from WOCE and SODA are used to give the stratification here. In this chapter, not only the barotropic energy budget and baroclinic energy budget but also the barotropic kinetic energy budget and baroclinic kinetic energy budget are analyzed. About 15.1 GW is transferred from the M2 barotropic tide to the baroclinic tide, which is about 88% of the barotropic input. The energy flux is about 4.5 GW, and the total dissipation is about 11.3 GW. The formula (Nycander, 2005) may underestimate the conversion rate at the Luzon ridge.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Houze</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global unification problem of the height system</title><secondary-title>Acta Geodaetica et Cartographica Sinica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Geodaetica et Cartographica Sinica</full-title></periodical><pages>939-944</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.11947/j.AGCS.2017.20170406</electronic-resource-num><notes>Xu, H.

In comparison with WOA13, the HYCOM's deep temperature deviation at 3000 m is mainly positive, while other five models' are negative. The deep temperature deviations increase with depth. The deep salinity deviations of HYCOM and OFES are mainly positive, while other models' are mainly negative. Both the temporal trends of mean temperature and salinity deviations are different from the observations. The currents between 1000 and 3000m are dominated by alternating westward and eastward zonal jets. The zonal velocity decreases quickly below 3000m, and the circulations are separated by different basins between 3000 and 5000m, but the seawater exchange can take place through deep-layer passages among basins. The transport in deep-layer passages shows seasonal variability; moreover, the direction of current in some deep layers could be opposite in different seasons. The pattern of circulation is controlled by potential vorticity constraint equation, and thus also shows seasonal variation, indicating temporal difference in the form of major rotations in these basins. In addition, we discussed the impacts of T/S initial value, tide, and other factors on the deep circulations, and proposed suggestions for future improvement in the modeling.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Wang, Ou</author><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Ponte, Rui M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECCO Version 4 Release 3</title></titles><periodical/><pages>10</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>1721.1/110380</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., Wang, O., Fenty, I., Forget, G., Heimbach, P., &amp;amp; Ponte, R.

More than 227000 people lost their lives during this catastrophe, 8200 of them in Thailand alone. Based on tsunami event layers retrieved at the Thai coast, the geological record shows that this was not the first tsunami that hit the area, and possible predecessors to the 2004 Tsunami have been identified in the geological record for the last two millennia. Most of the tsunamis worldwide are of tectonic origin, but it is well known, that earthquakes are not the only source for tsunamis. Submarine landslides can cause destructive tsunamis as well. Submarine landslides occur when a slope becomes unstable and fails. The stability of a slope depends largely on the sedimentary conditions, as these conditions govern the properties and the morphology of the sedimentary deposits. Thereby they dictate, whether failure preconditioning factors, such as rapid sedimentation, overpressure buildup or the presence of weak layers are developed. In order to assess the tsunami potential that may arise from a specific slope it is hence crucial to know the sedimentary processes and conditions that shape a margin. Moreover, it is important to know the failure history in order to estimate the frequency of failures and their dimensions. All this information may also help to assess the potential for future failures and for landslide tsunamis. The outer Thai shelf margin in the Andaman Sea has previously not been investigated in detail with respect to sediment dynamics and associated slope stability. Therefore, it was unknown so far, whether submarine mass wasting at this margin does occur and whether it may add to the tsunami hazard potential for the adjacent coasts. In order to examine the sedimentary development of this slope and in order to evaluate the state of the slope with respect to its stability and tsunami potential a new multibeam bathymetry and high resolution 2D multichannel reflection seismic data set was acquired during three subsequent research cruises (MASS I, MASS II and MASS III) in 2006, 2007 and 2011 from the Mergui Ridge area at the Thai outer shelf approximately 250km west off Phuket. The analysis of the newly acquired data shows that the Mergui Ridge, an area of low sedimentary input, is today shaped by bottom currents. This can be concluded from the presence of drift deposits adjacent to areas of low sedimentation or erosion of old sediments. Along-slope currents, fluctuating with the monsoon seasons and potentially also internal waves may be responsible for shaping the margin today. After a phase of uplift and subaerial exposure at the end of the Late Miocene, marked by a pronounced erosive unconformity, the Mergui Ridge shelf area subsided in the Pliocene to its recent position in up to 800m water depth. Tectonic deformation today is ongoing but on a smaller scale than in the past. This geological development is reflected in the older sedimentary deposits present in the Mergui Ridge area. This led to the deposition of a sedimentary unit characterized by indicators of local erosion when the ridge was in shallow water. Today a thin drape of undisturbed sediments partially covers these older sediments. Within the sediments of the Mergui Ridge area, seventeen mass transport deposits have been identified. Most of these deposits occur within drift deposits. Their presence shows that the slope has been unstable and failures have taken place repeatedly. The presence of fluids, instability of drift deposits and ongoing tectonic activity are considered as most important preconditioning factors; this setting may lead to failures in the future. Based on their mostly relative small dimension with volumes between approximately 0.3 and 14km3 , and the large water depth where the failures occur, it is unlikely for most of these failures to have been tsunamigenic, but triggering of tsunamis by such failures cannot be excluded. Based on the thickness of hemipelagic layers between events, the recurrence of these failures seems to be long, especially compared to the recurrence of tectonic tsunamis. A simple numerical modeling of landslide tsunami propagation and estimation of run up heighs based on geometrical parameters of the previously identified mass transport deposits of up to between 1.0 and 25.8m shows that landslides in the area may produce tsunamis. However, modeled tsunamis represent worst case scenarios and wave heights may be overestimated in the simple model.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vondrák, Jan</author><author>Ron, C.</author><author>Chapanov, Ya.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>New determination of period and quality factor of Chandler wobble, considering geophysical excitations</title><secondary-title>Advances in Space Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Space Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1395-1407</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.asr.2016.12.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vondrák, J., Ron, C., &amp;amp; Chapanov, Y.

The input data are 10311 hourly (ocean time) time steps of various 2D and 3D fields from a 22-billion point 1/48-degree “lat-lon cap” configuration of the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm). We map the global horizontal model domain onto our 128-screen (8×16) tiled display wall to produce a canonical tiling with approximately one MITgcm grid point per display pixel, and using this tiling we encode the entire time series for multiple native and computed scalar quantities at a collection of ocean depths. We reduce disk bandwidth requirements by converting the model's floating point data to 16-bit fixed point values, and compressing those values with a lossless video encoder, which together allow synchronized playback at 24 time steps per second across all 128 displays. The application allows dynamic assignment of any two encoded tiles to any display, and has multiple interfaces for quickly specifying various orderly arrangements of tiles. All subsequent rendering is done on the fly, with run time control of colormaps, transfer functions, histogram equalization, and labeling. The two data streams on each screen can be rendered independently and combined in various ways, including blending, differencing, horizontal/vertical wipes, and checkerboarding. The two data streams on any screen can optionally be displayed as a scatterplot in their joint attribute space. All scatterplots and map-view plots from the same x/y location and depth are linked so they all show the current brushable selection.

A coordinated set of Arctic modelling experiments, which explore how the Arctic responds to changes in external forcing, is proposed. Our goal is to compute and compare climate response functions (CRFs) – the transient response of key observable indicators such as sea-ice extent, freshwater content of the Beaufort Gyre, etc. – to abrupt step changes in forcing fields across a number of Arctic models. Changes in wind, freshwater sources, and inflows to the Arctic basin are considered. Convolutions of known or postulated time series of these forcing fields with their respective CRFs then yield the (linear) response of these observables. This allows the project to inform, and interface directly with, Arctic observations and observers and the climate change community. Here we outline the rationale behind such experiments and illustrate our approach in the context of a coarse-resolution model of the Arctic based on the MITgcm. We conclude by summarizing the expected benefits of such an activity and encourage other modelling groups to compute CRFs with their own models so that we might begin to document their robustness to model formulation, resolution, and parameterization.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bigdeli, Arash</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling Gas Budgets in Marginal Sea Ice Zones</title></titles><periodical/><pages>114</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><notes>Bigdeli, A.

The travel times of acoustic signals measure large-scale temperature, barotropic current, and, with an array of transceivers, relative vorticity. Applications include measurements of currents in shallow harbors, basin- and global-scale temperature, and deep-water formation events at high latitudes. Acoustical observations in ice-covered regions are compelling. All such systems provide for underwater GPS. The common perception that the Argo float system obviates the need for acoustic tomography is an error. While tomographic systems as components of regional or global-scale Ocean Observing Systems represent real opportunities for new insights into long-term ocean variability, the practical implementations of sustained acoustical systems are challenging. Such challenges are programmatic or cultural, rather than scientific, however. Given the extraordinary climatological changes presently occurring, it is imperative that all available observational capabilities be thoroughly considered. Studies employing numerical ocean models are required to design optimal observing strategies that exploit the complementary nature of different measurements. Observing Systems require practical techniques to implement data assimilation with the tomographic measurements. Programmatic technical capability and manpower to sustain acoustical measurements is lacking. Successful implementation of tomographic systems will require a stronger symbiotic relation between acousticians and oceanographers.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Su, Zhan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preconditioning of Antarctic maximum sea ice extent by upper ocean stratification on a seasonal timescale</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>6307-6315</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2017GL073236</electronic-resource-num><notes>Su, Z.

The region accounts for 43% of oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO₂). This is foreseen to change with increasing greenhouse gas emissions due to ocean chemistry and climate feedbacks that regulate the carbon cycle in the Southern Ocean. Studies have already shown that Southern Ocean CO₂ is subject to interannual variability. Measuring and understanding this change has been difficult due to sparse observational data that is biased toward summer. This leaves a crucial gap in our understanding of the Southern Ocean CO₂ seasonal cycle, which needs to be resolved to adequately monitor change and gain insight into the drivers of interannual variability. Machine learning has been successful in estimating CO₂ in may parts of the ocean by extrapolating existing data with satellite measurements of proxy variables of CO₂. However, in the Southern Ocean machine learning has proven less successful. Large differences between machine learning estimates stem from the paucity of data and complexity of the mechanisms that drive CO₂. In this study the aim is to reduce the uncertainty of estimates, advance our understanding of the interannual drivers, and optimise sampling of CO₂ in the Southern Ocean. Improving the estimates of CO₂ was achieved by investigating: the impact of increasing the gridding resolution of input data and proxy variables, and Support vector regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) as alternate machine learning methods. It was found that the improvement gained by increasing gridding resolution was minimal and only RFR was able to improve on existing error estimates. Yet, there was good agreement of the seasonal cycle and interannual trends between RFR, SVR and estimates from the literature. The ensemble mean of these methods was used to investigate the variability and interannual trends of CO₂ in the Southern Ocean. The interannual trends of the ensemble confirmed trends reported in the literature. A weakening of the sink in the early 2000's, followed by a strengthening a strengthening of the sink into the early 2010's. Wind was the overall driver of dominant decadal interannual trends, being more important during winter due to the increased efficacy of entrainment processes. Summer interannual variability of CO₂ was driven primarily by chlorophyll, which responded to basin scale changes in drivers by the complex interaction with underlying physics and possibly sub-mesoscale processes. Lastly CO₂ sampling platforms, namely ships, profiling floats and moorings, were tested in an idealised simulated model environment using a machine learning approach. Ships, simulated from existing cruise tracks, failed to adequately resolve CO₂ below the uncertainty threshold that is required to resolve the seasonal cycle of Southern Ocean CO₂. Eight high frequency sampling moorings narrowly outperformed 200 profiling floats, which were both able to adequately resolve the seasonal cycle. Though, a combination of ships and profiling floats achieved the smallest error.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Colosi, John</author><author>Duda, Timothy</author><author>Dzieciuch, Matthew</author><author>Howe, Bruce</author><author>Kaneko, Arata</author><author>Sagen, Hanne</author><author>Skarsoulis, Emmanuel</author><author>Zhu, Xiaohua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Acoustic Tomography : a Missing Element of the Ocean Observing System</title><secondary-title>Proceedings Underwater Acoustics Conference and Exhibition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings Underwater Acoustics Conference and Exhibition</full-title></periodical><pages>12</pages><keywords><keyword>basin-scale acoustics</keyword><keyword>integrated temperature measurement</keyword><keyword>long-range acoustic propagation</keyword><keyword>ocean acoustic tomography</keyword><keyword>physcial oceanography</keyword><keyword>underwater GPS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><notes>Dushaw, B., Colosi, J., Duda, T., Dzieciuch, M., Howe, B., Kaneko, A., … Zhu, X.

Examples include observations of deep mixing in the Greenland Sea, mode-1 internal tides radiating far into the ocean interior (coherent in time and space), relative vorticity on multiple scales, basin-wide and antipodal measures of temperature, barotropic currents, coastal processes in shallow water, and Arctic climate change. Despite the capabilities, tomography, and its simplified form thermometry, are not yet core observations within the Ocean Observing Systems (OOS). These observing systems could benefit greatly from applied acoustical oceanography, and both the world’s climatic circumstance and the difficulty in ocean observation argue that all available techniques should be implemented. A perception that the existence of the Argo float system obviates the need for the acoustical observations has been shown to be false; observations of ocean variability by tomography are distinct from those of floats or gliders. The growing application of acoustical measurements as part of the observing system (e.g., IQOE orunderwater GPS systems) make tomography a natural component of OOSes. The developing INTAROS system is demonstrating the integration of diverse observations, including passive and active acoustical applications, into a coherent, operational system – part of the Arctic Ocean Observing System. Within the Framework for Ocean Observing (FOO), we reiterate the recommendation of the OceanObs’99 conference and advocate a tomography system in the western North Atlantic as an initial contribution. Such a system would provide unique measurements of large-scale temperature, barotropic currents, vorticity, fluxes, and abyssal variability, while providing tracking capabilities for deep floats and gliders. This initial design, and the sustained system that would evolve from it, would result in a more complete fit-for-purpose overall observing system for essential ocean variables (EOVs) and derived quantities.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pennisi, Elizabeth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Making waves</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1006-1009</pages><volume>355</volume><issue>6329</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.355.6329.1006</electronic-resource-num><notes>Pennisi, E.

Statistical results show that the simulated halocline is reliable. Comparing of the September sea ice extent between simulation and SSM/I dataset, a consistent interannual variability is found between them. Moreover, both the simulated and observed September sea ice extent show staircase declines in 2000–2008 compared to 1990–1999. That supports that the abrupt variations of the ocean surface stress curl anomaly in 2000–2008 are caused by rapid sea ice melting and also in favor of the realistic existence of the simulated variations. Responses to these changes can be found in the upper ocean circulation and the intermediate current variations in these two phases as well. The analysis shows that seasonal variations of the halocline are regulated by the seasonal variations of the Ekman pumping. On interannual time scale, the variations of the halocline have an inverse relationship with the ocean surface stress curl anomaly after 2000, while this relationship no longer applies in the 1990s. It is pointed out that the regime shift in the Canada Basin can be derived to illustrate this phenomenon. Specifically, the halocline variations are dominated by advection in the 1990s and Ekman pumping in the 2000s respectively. Furthermore, the regime shift is caused by changing Transpolar Drift pathway and Ekman pumping area due to spatial deformation of the center Beaufort high (BH) relative to climatology.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bashmachnikov, I.

The radial profile of the relative vorticity is ap- proximated with the Q-distribution. Expressions connecting the distributions of the horizontal and vertical velocity components in this type of vortices are obtained. The limitations for the applicability of the analytical solution are derived. The advantages and disadvantages of this model are shown in comparison with the radial distributions of the corresponding parameters in Scully and in Rayleigh vortices. In particular, it is shown that the Q-distribution can, in some sense, be considered as a com- promise solution between the two distributions above. The theory of columnar Q-vortices with helical structure is applied to the permanently existing anticyclonic Lofoten vortex of the Norwegian Sea. The mean radial distributions of various dynamics characteristics of the Lofoten vortex are obtained using simulations with the regional hydrodynamic model MIT. The reasons for formation of the observed vertical velocity structure are analyzed. It is shown that, in contrast to atmospheric synoptic structures, divergence of Ekman fluxes in the bottom layer affects only the lower part of the vortex. In the upper ocean, ascending vertical motion is observed in the Lofoten vortex. It is assumed that horizontal dis- persion of vortex energy, the most intense in the surface layer, plays an essential role in the formation of the field of vertical velocities in the upper part of its core.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bashmachnikov, I.L.</author><author>Sokolovskiy, M.A.</author><author>Belonenko, T.V.</author><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Isachsen, P.E.</author><author>Carton, X.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the vertical structure and stability of the Lofoten vortex in the Norwegian Sea</title><secondary-title>Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers</full-title></periodical><pages>1-27</pages><volume>128</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dsr.2017.08.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Bashmachnikov, I.

Satellite sea ice concentrations (SICs), together with several ocean parameters, are assimilated into a regional Arctic coupled ocean–sea ice model covering the period of 2000–2008 using the adjoint method. There is substantial improvement in the representation of the SIC spatial distribution, in particular with respect to the position of the ice edge and to the concentrations in the central parts of the Arctic Ocean during summer months. Seasonal cycles of total Arctic sea ice area show an overall improvement. During summer months, values of sea ice extent (SIE) integrated over the model domain become underestimated compared to observations, but absolute differences of mean SIE to the data are reduced in nearly all months and years. Along with the SICs, the sea ice thickness fields also become closer to observations, providing added value by the assimilation.

However, the exact pathways and role of topography in Southern Ocean upwelling remain largely unknown. Here we show detailed upwelling pathways in three dimensions, using hydrographic observations and particle tracking in high-resolution models. The analysis reveals that the northern-sourced deep waters enter the Antarctic Circumpolar Current via southward flow along the boundaries of the three ocean basins, before spiraling southeastward and upward through the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Upwelling is greatly enhanced at five major topographic features, associated with vigorous mesoscale eddy activity. Deep water reaches the upper ocean predominantly south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with a spatially nonuniform distribution. The timescale for half of the deep water to upwell from 30{\textdegree} S to the mixed layer is ~60{\textendash}90 years.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, M R</author><author>Sallée, J.-B.</author><author>Menezes, V V</author><author>Macdonald, A M</author><author>Meredith, M P</author><author>Newman, L</author><author>Pellichero, V</author><author>Roquet, F</author><author>Swart, S</author><author>W\r ahlin, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Southern Ocean in State of the Climate in 2016</title><secondary-title>Bull.

Further investigations reveal that zonal currents along the equator, the Wyrtki jets, dominate the salinity transport. During the positive IOD events, the Wyrtki jets have stronger westward anomalies. The positive skewness of the IOD explains that the amplitude of the anomalous Wyrtki jets is stronger in the positive IOD events than that in the negative events.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bender, Peter L</author><author>Betts, Casey R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean calibration approach for data from the GRACE Follow‐On mission</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>1218-1235</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO‐JPL ocean model</keyword><keyword>GRACE Follow‐On mission</keyword><keyword>geopotential variations at satellite altitude</keyword><keyword>mass distribution variations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JB012433</electronic-resource-num><notes>Bender, P.

In addition, the GRACE Follow?On mission is scheduled to be flown soon after the end of life of the GRACE mission in order to minimize the loss of valuable data on the Earth's gravity field changes. In view of the major benefits to hydrology and oceanography, as well as to other fields, it is desirable to investigate the fundamental limits to monitoring the time variations in the Earth's gravity field during GRACE?type missions. A simplified model is presented in this paper for making estimates of the effect of differential spurious accelerations of the satellites during times when four successive revolutions cross the Pacific Ocean. The analysis approach discussed is to make use of changes in the satellite separation observed during passages across low?latitude regions of the Pacific and of other oceans to correct for spurious accelerations of the satellites. The low?latitude regions of the Pacific and of other oceans are the extended regions where the a priori uncertainties in the time variations of the geopotential heights due to mass distribution changes are known best. In addition, advantage can be taken of the repeated crossings of the South Pole and the North Pole, since the uncertainties in changes in the geopotential heights at the poles during the time required for four orbit revolutions are likely to be small.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schodlok, M P</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Rignot, E J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ice shelf basal melt rates around Antarctica from simulations and observations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>1085-1109</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>0728 Ice shelves</keyword><keyword>4219 Continental shelf and slope processes</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>Antarctica</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>ice shelf basal melt</keyword><keyword>ice shelf ocean interaction</keyword><keyword>numerical modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JC011117</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schodlok, M.

Two simulations are carried out: the first is based on the original ECCO2 vertical discretization; the second has higher vertical resolution particularly at the depth range of ice shelf cavities. The original ECCO2 vertical discretization produces higher than observed melt rates and leads to a misrepresentation of Southern Ocean water mass properties and transports. In general, thicker levels at the base of the ice shelves lead to increased melting because of their larger heat capacity. This strengthens horizontal gradients and circulation within and outside the cavities and, in turn, warm water transports from the shelf break to the ice shelves. The simulation with more vertical levels produces basal melt rates (1735 ± 164 Gt/a) and patterns that are in better agreement with observations. Thinner levels in the sub-ice-shelf cavities improve the representation of a fresh/cold layer at the ice shelf base and of warm/salty water near the bottom, leading to a sharper pycnocline and reduced vertical mixing underneath the ice shelf. Improved water column properties lead to more accurate melt rates and patterns, especially for melt/freeze patterns under large cold-water ice shelves. At the 18 km grid spacing of the ECCO2 model configuration, the smaller, warm-water ice shelves cannot be properly represented, with higher than observed melt rates in both simulations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashkezari, Mohammad D</author><author>Hill, Christopher N</author><author>Follett, Christopher N</author><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic eddy detection and lifetime forecast using machine learning methods</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>12,212-234,241</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>eddy</keyword><keyword>eddy lifetime</keyword><keyword>machine learning</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>remote sensing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016GL071269</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ashkezari, M.

The machine learning models use daily maps of geostrophic velocity anomalies and are trained according to the phase angle between the zonal and meridional components at each grid point. The trained models are then used to identify the corresponding eddy phase patterns and to predict the lifetime of a detected eddy structure. The performance of the proposed method is examined at two dynamically different regions to demonstrate its robust behavior and region independency.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pillar, Helen R</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Johnson, Helen L</author><author>Marshall, David P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamical attribution of recent variability in Atlantic overturning</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3339-3352</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Atmosphere-ocean interaction</keyword><keyword>Circulation/ Dynamics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0727.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Pillar, H.

SAMW ventilates the subtropical thermocline on decadal timescales, providing nutrients for low-latitude productivity and potentially trapping anthropogenic carbon in the deep ocean interior for centuries. In this work, we investigate the spatial structure and timescales of mode water export and associated thermocline ventilation. We use passive tracers in an eddy-permitting, observationally-informed Southern Ocean model to identify the pathways followed by mode waters between their formation regions and the areas where they first enter the subtropics. We find that the pathways followed by the mode water tracers are largely set by the mean geostrophic circulation. Export from the Indian and Central Pacific mode water pools is primarily driven by large-scale gyre circulation, whereas export from the Australian and Atlantic pools is heavily influenced by the ACC. Export from the Eastern Pacific mode water pool is driven by a combination of deep boundary currents and subtropical gyre circulation. More than 50% of each mode water tracer reaches the subtropical thermocline within 50 years, with significant variability between pools. The Eastern Pacific pathway is especially efficient, with roughly 80% entering the subtropical thermocline within 50 years. The time required for 50% of the mode water tracers to leave the Southern Ocean domain varies significantly between mode water pools, from 9 years for the Indian mode water pool to roughly 40 years for the Central Pacific mode water pool.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tagliabue, A</author><author>Aumont, O</author><author>DeAth, R</author><author>Dunne, J P</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Galbraith, E</author><author>Misumi, K</author><author>Moore, J K</author><author>Ridgwell, A</author><author>Sherman, E</author><author>Stock, C</author><author>Vichi, M</author><author>Volker, C</author><author>Yool, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How well do global ocean biogeochemistry models simulate dissolved iron distributions?</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>149-174</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric co2</keyword><keyword>biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>dust deposition</keyword><keyword>ecosystem model</keyword><keyword>iron</keyword><keyword>marine-phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>natural fertilization</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic ocean</keyword><keyword>nutrient-limitation</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>particle concentration</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword><keyword>world ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015gb005289</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tagliabue, A., et al.

In large areas of the ocean, iron availability regulates the functioning of marine ecosystems and hence the ocean carbon cycle. Accordingly, our ability to quantify the drivers and impacts of fluctuations in ocean ecosystems and carbon cycling in space and time relies on first achieving an appropriate representation of the modern marine iron cycle in models. When the iron distributions from 13 global ocean biogeochemistry models are compared against the latest oceanic sections from the GEOTRACES program, we find that all models struggle to reproduce many aspects of the observed spatial patterns. Models that reflect the emerging evidence for multiple iron sources or subtleties of its internal cycling perform much better in capturing observed features than their simpler contemporaries, particularly in the ocean interior. We show that the substantial uncertainty in the input fluxes of iron results in a very wide range of residence times across models, which has implications for the response of ecosystems and global carbon cycling to perturbations. Given this large uncertainty, iron fertilization experiments based on any single current generation model should be interpreted with caution. Improvements to how such models represent iron scavenging and also biological cycling are needed to raise confidence in their projections of global biogeochemical change in the ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rocha, Cesar B</author><author>Gille, Sarah T</author><author>Chereskin, Teresa K</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonality of submesoscale dynamics in the Kuroshio Extension</title><secondary-title>Geophys.

Here we provide model-based evidence that the seasonally changing upper ocean stratification in the Kuroshio Extension also modulates submesoscale (here 10–100 km) inertia-gravity waves. Summertime restratification weakens submesoscale turbulence but enhances inertia-gravity waves near the surface. Thus, submesoscale turbulence and inertia-gravity waves undergo vigorous out-of-phase seasonal cycles. These results imply a strong seasonal modulation of the accuracy of geostrophic velocity diagnosed from submesoscale sea surface height delivered by the SurfaceWater and Ocean Topography satellite mission.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Xinfeng</author><author>Yu, Lisan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variations of the Global Net Air–Sea Heat Flux during the “Hiatus” Period (2001–10)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3647-3660</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0626.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Liang, X., and L.

For the 10-yr “hiatus” period, all products agree on an overall net heat gain over the global ice-free ocean, but the magnitude varies from 1.7 to 9.5 W m−2. The differences among products are particularly large in the Southern Ocean, where they cannot even agree on whether the region gains or loses heat on the annual mean basis. Decadal trends of Qnet differ significantly between products. ECCO and OAFlux–CERES show almost no trend, whereas ERA-Interim suggests a downward trend and NCEP1 shows an upward trend. Therefore, numerical simulations utilizing different surface flux forcing products will likely produce diverged trends of the ocean heat content during this period. The downward trend in ERA-Interim started from 2006, driven by a peculiar pattern change in the tropical regions....</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Vinogradova, N T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An assessment of basic processes controlling mean surface salinity over the global ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>7052-7058</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>freshwater flux</keyword><keyword>surface salinity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016GL069857</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

Time-mean budgets (1993–2010) are considered for the 10 m thick top layer. In general, D¯ tends to counteract F¯, but A¯ is important almost everywhere, and some regions show a main balance between A¯ and D¯ (Bay of Bengal, Arctic) or A¯ and F¯ (tropical Atlantic and Pacific). Advection tends to freshen the surface in the tropics and high latitudes, with opposite tendencies in midlatitudes. For various Ss¯ tropical extrema, A¯ adds to the F¯ tendencies in precipitation regions and opposes F¯ in evaporation regions. Long-term Ss¯ conditions thus reflect more than a simple diffusive adjustment to F¯, likely involving close interaction between wind- and buoyancy-driven circulation and mixing processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vondrák, Jan</author><author>Ron, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical fluids from different data sources, geomagnetic jerks, and their impact on Earth´s orientation</title><secondary-title>Acta Geodynamica et Geomaterialia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Geodynamica et Geomaterialia</full-title></periodical><pages>241-247</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.13168/AGG.2016.0005</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vondrak, J., and C.

We also test the hypothetic effect of geomagnetic jerks together with these alternative models and study how much the agreement with the observed Earth Orientation Parameters is improved. By using numerical integration of all five Earth orientation parameters, we demonstrate that different models of atmospheric/oceanic excitations lead to slightly different results, fitting relatively well with their observed values but showing changes both in amplitude and phase. In all cases the agreement improves substantially when the effect of geomagnetic jerks is added to geophysical fluids, and the differences in amplitude/phase almost disappear.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chien, Chia-Te</author><author>Mackey, Katherine R M</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Mahowald, Natalie M</author><author>Prospero, Joseph M</author><author>Paytan, Adina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of African dust deposition on phytoplankton in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean off Barbados</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>716-734</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>0414 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>0470 Nutrients and nutrient cycling</keyword><keyword>4801 Aerosols</keyword><keyword>4858 Population dynamics and ecology</keyword><keyword>Barbados</keyword><keyword>and modeling</keyword><keyword>atmospheric deposition</keyword><keyword>nutrient limitation</keyword><keyword>phytoplankton community structure</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015GB005334</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chien, C.-T., K.

Atmospheric deposition provides a relatively large influx of new nutrients and trace metals to the surface ocean in this region in comparison to other nutrient sources. However, the impact on native phytoplankton is muted due to the high ratio of nitrogen (N) to P (NO3:SRP &gt; 40) and the low P solubility of these aerosols. Atmospheric deposition induces P limitation in this LNLC region by adding more N and iron (Fe) relative to P. This favors the growth of Prochlorococcus, a genus characterized by low P requirements and highly efficient P acquisition mechanisms. A global three-dimensional marine ecosystem model that includes species-specific phytoplankton elemental quotas/stoichiometry and the atmospheric deposition of N, P, and Fe supports this conclusion. Future increases in aerosol N loading may therefore influence phytoplankton community structure in other LNLC areas, thereby affecting the biological pump and associated carbon sequestration.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Balmaseda, M</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Weaver, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Data Assimilation in Support of Climate Applications: Status and Perspectives</title><secondary-title>Ann Rev Mar Sci</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ann Rev Mar Sci</full-title></periodical><pages>491-518</pages><volume>8</volume><edition>2015/10/17</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26473335</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-marine-122414-034113</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., M.

Its applications are manifold, ranging from marine and ecosystem forecasting to climate prediction and studies of the carbon cycle. Here, we address only climate applications, which range from improving our understanding of ocean circulation to estimating initial or boundary conditions and model parameters for ocean and climate forecasts. Because of differences in underlying methodologies, data assimilation products must be used judiciously and selected according to the specific purpose, as not all related inferences would be equally reliable. Further advances are expected from improved models and methods for estimating and representing error information in data assimilation systems. Ultimately, data assimilation into coupled climate system components is needed to support ocean and climate services. However, maintaining the infrastructure and expertise for sustained data assimilation remains challenging.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Xu, Y</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mouginot, J</author><author>Scheuchl, B</author><author>Li, X</author><author>Morlighem, M</author><author>Seroussi, Hélène</author><author>van den Broeke, M</author><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Cai, C</author><author>An, L</author><author>de Fleurian, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling of ocean-induced ice melt rates of five west Greenland glaciers over the past two decades</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>6374-6382</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>calving</keyword><keyword>glaciology</keyword><keyword>greenland</keyword><keyword>ice-ocean interaction</keyword><keyword>mass balance</keyword><keyword>subaqueous melt</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016GL068784</electronic-resource-num><notes>Rignot, E., Xu, Y., Menemenlis, D., Mouginot, J., Scheuchl, B., Li, X., … de Fleurian, B.

Model forcing is from monthly reconstructions of ocean state and ice sheet runoff. Results are analyzed in combination with observations of bathymetry, bed elevation, ice front retreat, and glacier speed. We calculate that subaqueous melt rates are 2?3 times larger in summer compared to winter and doubled in magnitude since the 1990s due to enhanced subglacial runoff and 1.6 ± 0.3°C warmer ocean temperature. Umiamako and Kangilerngata retreated rapidly in the 2000s when subaqueous melt rates exceeded the calving rates and ice front retreated to deeper bed elevation. In contrast, Store, Kangerdlugssup, and Rinks have remained stable because their subaqueous melt rates are 3?4 times lower than their calving rates, i.e., the glaciers are dominated by calving processes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ocaña, Victor</author><author>Zorita, Eduardo</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stochastic secular trends in sea level rise</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>2183-2202</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>1641 Sea level change</keyword><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>autoregressive/integrated process</keyword><keyword>ocean variability</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JC011301</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ocaña, V., E.

Several studies that attempt to explain the long-term trend of GMSL during the instrumental record share the common assumption that this trend is deterministic in nature and different from natural variations. Here we show that the trend can alternatively be explained, at least in part, as being caused by random variations within the coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere system, and hence not having a deterministic origin. These random trends, which add to externally forced changes (e.g., through anthropogenic climate change), are a consequence of the integrated character of GMSL, which is the cumulative addition of temporal contributions that exhibit random character, and whose integration results in GMSL variations with persistence on decadal-centennial time scales. The generation of trends by integration of random stationary noise (i.e., even in a constant climate) is a robust and fundamental feature of stochastically forced systems with memory. The integrated character of GMSL results in an intrinsic difficulty in distinguishing internal from externally forced trends.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chaudhuri, A H</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Forget, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of uncertainties in atmospheric boundary conditions on ocean model solutions</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>96-108</pages><volume>100</volume><keywords><keyword>Atmospheric uncertainty</keyword><keyword>Global ocean modeling</keyword><keyword>Reanalysis</keyword><keyword>arctic-ocean</keyword><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>equatorial pacific</keyword><keyword>era-interim</keyword><keyword>fluxes</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword><keyword>sea-ice</keyword><keyword>simulations</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2016.02.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chaudhuri, A.

For this purpose, we use a global configuration of the MITgcm to simulate 4 ocean solutions for 2000-2009 using 4 reanalysis products (JRA-25, MERRA, CFSR and ERA-Interim) as atmospheric forcing. The simulations are compared against observations and against each other for selected variables (temperature, sea-level, sea-ice, streamfunctions, meridional heat and freshwater transports). Forcing-induced differences are comparable in magnitude to model-observation misfits for most near-surface variables in the tropics and sub-tropics, but typically smaller at higher latitudes and polar regions. Forcing-derived differences are expectedly largest near the surface and mostly limited to the upper 1000 m but can also be seen as deep as 4000 m, especially in regions of deep water formation. Errors are not necessarily local in nature and can be advected to different basins. Results indicate that while forcing adjustments might suffice in optimization procedures of near-surface fields and at low-to-mid latitudes, other control parameters are likely needed elsewhere. Forcing-induced differences can be dominated by large spatial scales and specific time scales (e.g. annual), and thus appropriate error covariances in space and time need to be considered in optimization methodologies.

Analysis of ocean and forcing fields from a data-assimilating ocean synthesis (ECCOv4) suggests that two equally important mechanisms of wind-driven heat redistribution within the Indian Ocean account for a majority of the decadal variability. The first is the Cross-Equatorial Cell (CEC) forced by zonal wind stress curl at the equator. The wind stress curl variability relates to the strength and position of the Mascarene High, which is influenced by the phase of the Indian Ocean Subtropical Dipole. The second mechanism is deep (700 m) upwelling related to zonal wind stress at the equator that causes deep, cross-equatorial overturning due to the unique geometry of the basin. The CEC acts to cool the upper ocean throughout most of the first decade of satellite altimetry, while the deep upwelling delays and then amplifies the effect of the CEC on SSH. During the subsequent decade, reversals in the forcing anomalies drive warming of the upper ocean and increasing SSH, with the effect of the deep upwelling leading the CEC.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ngeve, Magdalene N</author><author>Van der Stocken, Tom</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Koedam, Nico</author><author>Triest, Ludwig</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contrasting Effects of Historical Sea Level Rise and Contemporary Ocean Currents on Regional Gene Flow of Rhizophora racemosa in Eastern Atlantic Mangroves</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e0150950</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0150950</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ngeve, M.

Therefore, investigating their patterns of gene flow provides insights on the processes involved in the spatial genetic structuring of populations. The coastline of Cameroon has a particular geomorphological history and coastal hydrology with complex contemporary patterns of ocean currents, which we hypothesize to have effects on the spatial configuration and composition of present-day mangroves within its spans. A total of 982 trees were sampled from 33 transects (11 sites) in 4 estuaries. Using 11 polymorphic SSR markers, we investigated genetic diversity and structure of Rhizophora racemosa, a widespread species in the region. Genetic diversity was low to moderate and genetic differentiation between nearly all population pairs was significant. Bayesian clustering analysis, PCoA, estimates of contemporary migration rates and identification of barriers to gene flow were used and complemented with estimated dispersal trajectories of hourly released virtual propagules, using high-resolution surface current from a mesoscale and tide-resolving ocean simulation. These indicate that the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL) is not a present-day barrier to gene flow. Rather, the Inter-Bioko-Cameroon (IBC) corridor, formed due to sea level rise, allows for connectivity between two mangrove areas that were isolated during glacial times by the CVL. Genetic data and numerical ocean simulations indicated that an oceanic convergence zone near the Cameroon Estuary complex (CEC) presents a strong barrier to gene flow, resulting in genetic discontinuities between the mangrove areas on either side. This convergence did not result in higher genetic diversity at the CEC as we had hypothesized. In conclusion, the genetic structure of Rhizophora racemosa is maintained by the contrasting effects of the contemporary oceanic convergence and historical climate change-induced sea level rise.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Song, Hajoon</author><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Forget, Gaël</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Source waters for the highly productive Patagonian shelf in the southwestern Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Marine Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Marine Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>120-128</pages><volume>158</volume><keywords><keyword>Adjoint sensitivity analysis</keyword><keyword>Nutrient sources</keyword><keyword>Patagonian shelf</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>Vertical mixing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jmarsys.2016.02.009</electronic-resource-num><notes>Song, H., J.

Using a passive tracer adjoint sensitivity experiment, we identify three source waters: waters local to the Patagonian shelf, coastal waters near the Chilean coast and the subsurface waters in the southeast Pacific. We perform a series of forward simulations of a biogeochemical model to investigate the impact of nutrient perturbations in these source regions to productivity on the Patagonian shelf. Positive nitrate perturbations from local waters have an immediate impact elevating productivity. Iron perturbations local to the shelf, however, do not change productivity because the shelf region is limited by nitrate. Additional nutrient supply from the other source regions leads to increases in productivity. We find that positive nutrient perturbations in subsurface waters in the southeast Pacific result in the largest boost of productivity over the shelf. These source waters are rich in nutrients and upwelled from the depth where light levels are so low that they cannot be consumed. Finally, we identify wintertime intense vertical mixing as the key process which draws nutrients from below 300–500 m to the surface before being delivered to the shelf.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, Nadya</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Durack, Paul</author><author>Boutin, Jacqueline</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Salinity and the Water Cycle: Recent Progress and Future Challenges</title><secondary-title>GEWEX News</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEWEX News</full-title></periodical><pages>6-8</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><notes>Vinogradova, N., T.

At scales between 10 and 200 km, the ADCP kinetic energy spectra approximately follow a k−3 power law. The observed flows are more energetic at the surface, but the shape of the kinetic energy spectra is independent of depth. These characteristics resemble predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The ratio of across-track to along-track kinetic energy spectra, however, significantly departs from the expectation of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The inconsistency is dramatic at scales smaller than 40 km. A Helmholtz decomposition of the ADCP spectra and analyses of synthetic and numerical model data show that horizontally divergent, ageostrophic flows account for the discrepancy between the observed spectra and predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. In Drake Passage, ageostrophic motions appear to be dominated by inertia–gravity waves and account for about half of the near-surface kinetic energy at scales between 10 and 40 km. Model results indicate that ageostrophic flows imprint on the sea surface, accounting for about half of the sea surface height variance between 10 and 40 km.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Weiwei</author><author>van Dam, Tonie</author><author>Li, Zhao</author><author>Shen, Yunzhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Annual variation detected by GPS, GRACE and loading models</title><secondary-title>Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica</full-title></periodical><pages>608-621</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11200-016-0205-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Li, W., T. van Dam, Z.

This paper compares the annual signals of the GPS position time series from the Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS), estimates of loading from GRACE monthly gravity field models calculated by three processing centers (Center of Spatial Research, CSR; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL; GeoForschungsZentrum, GFZ) and three geophysical fluids models (National Center for Environmental Prediction, NCEP; Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, ECCO; Global Land Data Assimilation System, GLDAS) for 270 globally distributed stations for the period 2003-2011. The results show that annual variations derived from the level-2 products from the three GRACE product centers are very similar. The absolute difference in annual amplitude between any two centers is never larger than 1.25 mm in the vertical and 0.11 mm in horizontal displacement. The mean phase differences of the GRACE results are less than ten days for all three components. When we correct the GPS vertical coordinate time series using the GRACE annual amplitudes using the products from three GRACE analysis centers, we find that we are able to reduce the GPS annual signal in the vertical at about 80% stations and the average reduction is about 47%. In the north and the east, the annual amplitude is reduced on 77% and 72% of the stations with the average reduction 32% and 33%. We also compare the annual surface displacement signal derived from two environmental models; the two models use the same atmospheric and non-tidal ocean loading and differ only in the continental water storage model that we use, either NCEP or GLDAS. We find that the model containing the GLDAS continental water storage is able to better reduce the annual signal in the GPS coordinate time series.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danabasoglu, Gokhan</author><author>Yeager, Steve G</author><author>Kim, Who M</author><author>Behrens, Erik</author><author>Bentsen, Mats</author><author>Bi, Daohua</author><author>Biastoch, Arne</author><author>Bleck, Rainer</author><author>Böning, Claus</author><author>Bozec, Alexandra</author><author>Canuto, Vittorio M</author><author>Cassou, Christophe</author><author>Chassignet, Eric</author><author>Coward, Andrew C</author><author>Danilov, Sergey</author><author>Diansky, Nikolay</author><author>Drange, Helge</author><author>Farneti, Riccardo</author><author>Fernandez, Elodie</author><author>Fogli, Pier Giuseppe</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Griffies, Stephen M</author><author>Gusev, Anatoly</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Howard, Armando</author><author>Ilicak, Mehmet</author><author>Jung, Thomas</author><author>Karspeck, Alicia R</author><author>Kelley, Maxwell</author><author>Large, William G</author><author>Leboissetier, Anthony</author><author>Lu, Jianhua</author><author>Madec, Gurvan</author><author>Marsland, Simon J</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Navarra, Antonio</author><author>Nurser, A J George</author><author>Pirani, Anna</author><author>Romanou, Anastasia</author><author>Salas y Mélia, David</author><author>Samuels, Bonita L</author><author>Scheinert, Markus</author><author>Sidorenko, Dmitry</author><author>Sun, Shan</author><author>Treguier, Anne-Marie</author><author>Tsujino, Hiroyuki</author><author>Uotila, Petteri</author><author>Valcke, Sophie</author><author>Voldoire, Aurore</author><author>Wang, Qiang</author><author>Yashayaev, Igor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>North Atlantic simulations in Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments phase II (CORE-II).

These simulations are performed as contributions to the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II). The study is Part II of our companion paper (Danabasoglu et al., 2014) which documented the mean states in the North Atlantic from the same models. A major focus of the present study is the representation of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) variability in the participating models. Relationships between AMOC variability and those of some other related variables, such as subpolar mixed layer depths, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Labrador Sea upper-ocean hydrographic properties, are also investigated. In general, AMOC variability shows three distinct stages. During the first stage that lasts until the mid- to late-1970s, AMOC is relatively steady, remaining lower than its long-term (1958–2007) mean. Thereafter, AMOC intensifies with maximum transports achieved in the mid- to late-1990s. This enhancement is then followed by a weakening trend until the end of our integration period. This sequence of low frequency AMOC variability is consistent with previous studies. Regarding strengthening of AMOC between about the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, our results support a previously identified variability mechanism where AMOC intensification is connected to increased deep water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic, driven by NAO-related surface fluxes. The simulations tend to show general agreement in their temporal representations of, for example, AMOC, sea surface temperature (SST), and subpolar mixed layer depth variabilities. In particular, the observed variability of the North Atlantic SSTs is captured well by all models. These findings indicate that simulated variability and trends are primarily dictated by the atmospheric datasets which include the influence of ocean dynamics from nature superimposed onto anthropogenic effects. Despite these general agreements, there are many differences among the model solutions, particularly in the spatial structures of variability patterns. For example, the location of the maximum AMOC variability differs among the models between Northern and Southern Hemispheres.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Dangendorf, Sönke</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Marcos, Marta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Annual Sea Level Changes on the North American Northeast Coast: Influence of Local Winds and Barotropic Motions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>4801-4816</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Atm/Ocean Structure/ Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Barotropic flows</keyword><keyword>Circulation/ Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Decadal variability</keyword><keyword>Geographic location/entity</keyword><keyword>Interannual variability</keyword><keyword>North Atlantic Ocean</keyword><keyword>Ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>Sea level</keyword><keyword>Variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0048.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

In this study, annual sea level records (adjusted for the inverted barometer effect) from tide gauges along the North American northeast coast over 1980–2010 are compared to a set of data-assimilating ocean reanalysis products as well as a global barotropic model solution forced with wind stress and barometric pressure. Correspondence between models and data depends strongly on model and location. At sites north of Cape Hatteras, the barotropic model shows as much (if not more) skill than ocean reanalyses, explaining about 50% of the variance in the adjusted annual tide gauge sea level records. Additional numerical experiments show that annual sea level changes along this coast from the barotropic model are driven by local wind stress over the continental shelf and slope. This result is interpreted in the light of a simple dynamic framework, wherein bottom friction balances surface wind stress in the alongshore direction and geostrophy holds in the across-shore direction. Results highlight the importance of barotropic dynamics on coastal sea level changes on interannual and decadal time scales; they also have implications for diagnosing the uncertainties in current ocean reanalyses, using tide gauge records to infer past changes in ocean circulation, and identifying the physical mechanisms responsible for projected future regional sea level rise.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Ocean Integrals and Means, with Trend Implications</title><secondary-title>Ann Rev Mar Sci</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ann Rev Mar Sci</full-title></periodical><pages>1-33</pages><volume>8</volume><edition>2015/09/04</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26331897</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-marine-122414-034040</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C.

Attempts to determine means, integrals, and climatologies have been hindered by thinly and poorly distributed historical observations in a system in which both signals and background noise are spatially very inhomogeneous, leading to potentially large temporal bias errors that must be corrected at the 1% level or better. With the exception of the upper ocean in the current altimetric-Argo era, no clear documentation exists on the best methods for estimating means and their changes for quantities such as heat and freshwater at the levels required for anthropogenic signals. Underestimates of trends are as likely as overestimates; for example, recent inferences that multidecadal oceanic heat uptake has been greatly underestimated are plausible. For new or augmented observing systems, calculating the accuracies and precisions of global, multidecadal sampling densities for the full water column is necessary to avoid the irrecoverable loss of scientifically essential information.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scharffenberg, Martin G</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Testing the Quality of Sea-Level Data Using the GECCO Adjoint Assimilation Approach</title><secondary-title>Surveys in Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surveys in Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-35</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10712-016-9401-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Scharffenberg, M.

Based on decreased GECCO2 model–data residuals, upon using the altimeter data through the ESA climate change initiative (cci) sea-level (SL) project, we show here that the recently reprocessed ESA SL_cci altimeter data set (SL1) has been improved relative to the earlier AVISO altimetry data set and is now more consistent with the GECCO2 estimate and with the information about the changing ocean state embedded in other ocean data sets. The improvement can be shown to exist separately for both TOPEX/POSEIDON and ERS data sets. The study reveals that especially in regions characterized by small sea surface height (SSH) variability and small signal-to-noise ratio in the SSH data, improvements can be on the order of 30% of previously existing model–data residuals. However, in some regions we can find degradations, particulary in those where GECCO2 has little skill in representing the altimeter data and where evaluation of the products with GECCO2 is thus not advisable. Upon the assimilation of the new SL1 data set, the GECCO2 synthesis was further improved. However, adding the sea surface temperature (SST) from the SST_cci project as additional constrain, no further impact can be identified.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nie, Xunwei</author><author>Gao, Shan</author><author>Wang, Fan</author><author>Qu, Tangdong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subduction of North Pacific Tropical Water and its equatorward pathways as shown by a simulated passive tracer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>8770-8786</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4283 Water masses</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>4576 Western boundary currents</keyword><keyword>North Pacific Tropical Water</keyword><keyword>mixing</keyword><keyword>pathway</keyword><keyword>resurface</keyword><keyword>subduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><isbn>0022-3670</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JC012305</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nie, X., S.

The results show that approximately 5.8 Sv (1 Sv [ 106m3 s-1) of the SPTW is formed in the subtropical South Pacific Ocean within the density range between 24.0 and 25.0 kgm-3, of which about 87% is due to vertical pumping and 13% is due to lateral induction, comparing reasonably well with estimates from climatological data. Once subducted, most SPTW spreads in the subtropical South Pacific. Because of the presence of mixing, some portion of the water is transformed, and its tracer-weighted density steadily increases from an initial value of 24.4 to nearly 25.0 kgm-3 after 13 years of integration. Approximately 42% of the water makes its way into the equatorial Pacific, either through the western boundary or interior pathway. The two equatorward pathways are essentially of equal importance. A large (~70%) portion of the SPTW entering the equatorial region resurfaces in the central equatorial Pacific.

The Peregrine PE model was developed as an re-coding in C of the Range-dependent Acoustic Model (RAM). This code was extended to 3-dimensions by applying the split-step Pade kernel in cross-range at each range step. The kernel of Peregrine (Seahawks) has been submitted to the Ocean Atmospheric Media Library (OAML). Peregrine was applied to hydroacoustic recordings from a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) of a seismic tomography experiment off of Japan, with excellent quantitative agreement in both the energy received and the travel time, both exhibiting strong 3D propagation. A paper was published on using noise correlations to estimate local sound speed, as well as the horizontal deflection caused by mesoscale eddies as they traverse long ranges. Propagation and ambient noise analysis was conducted on the North Pacific Acoustics Laboratory Philippine Sea tests 2009 and 2010, both of which Dr. Heaney participated as a co-chief scientist.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McNeely, Jeffrey A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biodiversity in a Changing Climate: Linking Science and Management in Conservation edited by Terry L.

However, the extent of this contribution remains poorly constrained. The concept of ocean convective available potential energy (OCAPE) is developed to improve the un- derstanding and the prediction for these deep convection events. The kinetic energy (KE) budget of deep convection is explored analytically and numerically based on the observations in the Weddell Sea. OCAPE, which is derived from thermobaricity, is identified as a critical KE source to power ocean deep convection. Other significant contributions to the energetics of convection, including diabatic processes related to cabbeling and stratification are also carefully quantified. An associated theory is de- veloped to predict the maximum depth of convection. This work may provide a useful basis for improving the convection parameterization in ocean models. As an application of the theory above, basin-scale OCAPE is found to be signifi- cantly built up in North Atlantic at the end of Heinrich Stadial 1 ( ∼17,000 years ago). This OCAPE is ultimately released to power strong ocean deep convection in North Atlantic as simulated by numerical models. This causes a ∼2 o C sea surface warming for the whole basin (∼700 km) within a month and exposes a huge heat reservoir to the atmosphere. This may invigorate the Atlantic meridional overturning circu- lation and provides an important mechanism to explain the abrupt Bolling-Allerod warming. Mesoscale turbulence is another crucial process for high-latitude ocean dynam- ics. From the physical nature of baroclinic instability, the framework of eddy-size- constrained Available Potential Energy (APE) density is developed, which is capable of well detecting individual eddies and local eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the World Ocean. This new framework is likely useful in parameterizing mesoscale eddies in ocean GCMs. Mesoscale turbulence are found to be coupled to the wind-driven Ek- man pumping in determining the temperature and salinity budgets in subpolar gyres such as the Weddell Gyre. Topography is shown to be another crucial dynamic factor that modulates the potential vorticity budget and hence strongly influences the strati- fication of subpolar gyres. Considering these factors, a physical model is developed to predict the observed temperature and salinity variability around the Antarctic mar- gins. This model is useful for understanding and predicting the export of Antarctic Bottom Water and hence the associated high-latitude ocean transport of heat, salt and nutrients.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nowicki, Sophie M.

Reducing the uncertainty in the past, present, and future contribution of ice sheets to sea-level change requires a coordinated effort between the climate and glaciology communities. The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) is the primary activity within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project &amp;ndash; phase 6 (CMIP6) focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. In this paper, we describe the framework for ISMIP6 and its relationship with other activities within CMIP6. The ISMIP6 experimental design relies on CMIP6 climate models and includes, for the first time within CMIP, coupled ice-sheet&amp;ndash;climate models as well as standalone ice-sheet models. To facilitate analysis of the multi-model ensemble and to generate a set of standard climate inputs for standalone ice-sheet models, ISMIP6 defines a protocol for all variables related to ice sheets. ISMIP6 will provide a basis for investigating the feedbacks, impacts, and sea-level changes associated with dynamic ice sheets and for quantifying the uncertainty in ice-sheet-sourced global sea-level change.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scanlon, Bridget R.</author><author>Zhang, Zizhan</author><author>Save, Himanshu</author><author>Wiese, David N.</author><author>Landerer, Felix W.</author><author>Long, Di</author><author>Longuevergne, Laurent</author><author>Chen, Jianli</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global evaluation of new GRACE mascon products for hydrologic applications</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Research</full-title></periodical><pages>9412-9429</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016WR019494</electronic-resource-num><notes>Scanlon, B.

In the time-average state, the Meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the Indian Ocean presents a consistent structure in each set of data, that is, the bottom and deep water bodies enter the Indian Ocean to the north, and the counter-clockwise structure of the Indian Ocean flows southward and southward. Through the dynamic decomposition of the meridional overturning circulation, the paper analyzes the similarities and differences of each power part in each set of data. In each set of data, the Ekman part of the South Indian Ocean presents a consistent counterclockwise flip structure with the highest intensity at 10°S; the ground rotation and the outer mold part exhibit similar clockwise and counterclockwise flip structures respectively at 10°S south. At 27°S, the intensity is the largest and the sign is opposite; relatively speaking, the Ekman part is more obvious between the 20°S and the equator, and the ground rotation and the outer part are more in the area south of 25°S. obvious. Based on different dynamic thermal forcings, there are significant differences in the spatial extent and intensity of each dynamic part of the flow function in each set of data: Since the wind fields of each set of data are not much different, the overall structure of the Ekman part is similar, and the intensity difference is small; In the geostrophic part, the difference in the strength of the clockwise flip structure exhibited by each data is mainly affected by the strength of the baroclinic flow field in the inner zone and the structure of the western boundary flow. The stronger the baroclinic flow field in the inner zone, the stronger the flip structure; the west boundary The wider the flow width, the greater the influence on the baroclinic flow field in the inner zone, and the greater the weakening of the inversion structure strength; the strength of the partially inverted structure of the outer die is affected by the strength of the western boundary flow: the greater the strength of the western boundary flow, the outer mode The greater the strength of the partially inverted structure.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pemberton, P.</author><author>Nilsson, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The response of the central Arctic Ocean stratification to freshwater perturbations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>792-817</pages><volume>121</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JC011003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Pemberton, P., &amp;amp; Nilsson, J.

The Chukchi Sea is the only pathway for Pacific water to enter the Arctic Ocean. While the Chukchi naturally undergoes large seasonal and interannual variability, currently it is also undergoing larger and rapid changes, which include transition to a longer ice-free season. Numerical models are often used to explore this region, due to observational restrictions associated with sea-ice. Most past and current models tend to represent riverine inputs in a non-realistic manner; adding freshwater on or past the shelf break, not accounting for seasonality of the river discharge, and omitting riverine heat content. In addition, in many of these models, buoyant coastal currents are not well resolved. Here, I present a new river discharge and river temperature data set (at 1/6° resolution). Employing this new data set within a high-resolution pan-Arctic model, freshwater content on the Arctic shelves increased by ~3600 km3 and summ er heat fluxes increased by 8 TW (compared to previous models), resulting in a reduction o f the Arctic-wide September sea ice extent by up to ~10%. With both the improved riverine forcing included in the model calculations, and the model’s ability to resolve the Alaskan Coastal Current, the model suggests an additional 0.25 Sv of flow to the long-term Bering Strait volume transport. This translates to a 64% increase in the heat transport and a 32% increase in freshwater transport (including 4% from sea ice). The model also resolves individual transport pathways in the Chukchi Sea, including that of Bering Sea Water, which could influence species composition and distribution in the eastern Chukchi Sea. Increased computing power and improved observational tools lead to more accurate reproductions of coastal currents and riverine influences in these numerical models. Greater understanding of this near-shore region and its influences is vital to further interpret larger connections between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as Arctic-wide and global oceanic changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Zhongxiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Internal tide oceanic tomography</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>9157-9164</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016GL070567</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhao, Z.

Data assimilation experiments that aim at improving summer ice concentration and thickness forecasts in the Arctic are carried out. The data assimilation system used is based on the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) and a local singular evolutive interpolated Kalman (LSEIK) filter. The effect of using sea ice concentration satellite data products with appropriate uncertainty estimates is assessed by three different experiments using sea ice concentration data of the European Space Agency Sea Ice Climate Change Initiative (ESA SICCI) which are provided with a per-grid-cell physically based sea ice concentration uncertainty estimate. The first experiment uses the constant uncertainty, the second one imposes the provided SICCI uncertainty estimate, while the third experiment employs an elevated minimum uncertainty to account for a representation error. Using the observation uncertainties that are provided with the data improves the ensemble mean forecast of ice concentration compared to using constant data errors, but the thickness forecast, based on the sparsely available data, appears to be degraded. Further investigating this lack of positive impact on the sea ice thicknesses leads us to a fundamental mismatch between the satellite-based radiometric concentration and the modeled physical ice concentration in summer: the passive microwave sensors used for deriving the vast majority of the sea ice concentration satellite-based observations cannot distinguish ocean water (in leads) from melt water (in ponds). New data assimilation methodologies that fully account or mitigate this mismatch must be designed for successful assimilation of sea ice concentration satellite data in summer melt conditions.

With simulated data sets from atmospheric models, scientists are able to examine the driving forces of atmospheric phenomena and perform advanced analysis. Due to the inherent complexity and computational intensity of atmospheric models, running such models requires considerable amounts of computing resources. Traditionally, high-performance supercomputers or clusters have been used to perform atmospheric modeling. Recently, cloud computing solutions are emerged as a cost-effective approach to provide on-demand computing resources, remove the technical barriers, and reduce the high costs for computing facility management and maintenance. This chapter presents the design and implementation of a cloud-based framework to facilitate atmospheric modeling. The framework consists of a web portal, cloud instances, and a cloud-based data repository. To evaluate the feasibility of the framework, we have customized and deployed the serial processing version of ModelE onto our framework. Upon the deployment, we conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate the readiness of cloud computing resources to support large-scale atmospheric modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the framework provides scalable and customizable computing resources that meet the computational needs of atmospheric modeling.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maulik, Romit</author><author>San, Omer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic modeling of the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient for quasigeostrophic ocean circulation problems</title><secondary-title>Journal of Ocean Engineering and Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Ocean Engineering and Science</full-title></periodical><pages>300-324</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.joes.2016.08.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Maulik, R., &amp;amp; San, O.

In order to provide timely and reliable sea ice forecast protection for the Arctic ice area shipping activities, it is urgent to improve the sea ice forecast level. This paper is based on the general circulation of MIT. Model (MIT-gcm), using the Newton Relaxation Approximation (Nudging) data assimilation method to assimilate the sea ice intensity data of the second generation advanced microwave radiation imager (AMSR2) of the University of Bremen, Germany, into the model, establishing Arctic sea ice Numerical prediction system. The design experiment compares the improvement effects of three different Nudging coefficient calculation schemes. The results show that different schemes can significantly improve the initial field of sea ice concentration after selecting appropriate parameters. By designing two groups of prediction experiments with or without Nudging assimilation, Combined with the satellite remote sensing sea ice intensity and the nautical ice intensity observation data of the &quot;Snow Dragon&quot; ship during the fifth Arctic scientific expedition in China, quantitative analysis of the 24-120 h forecast of the Arctic sea ice concentration by the Nudging assimilation program. The improvement results. The results show that the Nudging assimilation has a spatial distribution of the total Arctic sea ice concentration within 120 h and the sea ice intensification of the moving single point target. Prediction results were significantly improved; however, in the case of a small change in ice, 24 ~ 120 h forecast Nudging assimilation test results are inferior to the results of prediction of inertia, needs to be further improved forecasting techniques described numerical forecasting system based Nudging assimilation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jung, Thomas</author><author>Gordon, Neil D.</author><author>Bauer, Peter</author><author>Bromwich, David H.</author><author>Chevallier, Matthieu</author><author>Day, Jonathan J.</author><author>Dawson, Jackie</author><author>Doblas-Reyes, Francisco</author><author>Fairall, Christopher</author><author>Goessling, Helge F.</author><author>Holland, Marika</author><author>Inoue, Jun</author><author>Iversen, Trond</author><author>Klebe, Stefanie</author><author>Lemke, Peter</author><author>Losch, Martin</author><author>Makshtas, Alexander</author><author>Mills, Brian</author><author>Nurmi, Pertti</author><author>Perovich, Donald</author><author>Reid, Philip</author><author>Renfrew, Ian A.</author><author>Smith, Gregory</author><author>Svensson, Gunilla</author><author>Tolstykh, Mikhail</author><author>Yang, Qinghua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Advancing Polar Prediction Capabilities on Daily to Seasonal Time Scales</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>1631-1647</pages><volume>97</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00246.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Jung, T., Gordon, N.

In winter, cold water descents in cyclonic gyres of the North-Eurоpean basin [Anna1] of the Arctic Ocean and in the Baffin Bay, thus feeding the southward moving deep branch of the global thermohaline circulation. Changes in the Arctic climate system in 1990-2000 had affected convective processes in the Nordic seas too. Instead of a massive penetration of surface water to a considerable depth in the Greenland Sea, as was observed in the 20th century, deep mesoscale eddies similar in structure to the intrapycnocline lenses in the Lofoten Basin of the Norwegian Sea started to appear in observations. It is impossible to judge from just formal resemblance whether the physical processes leading to the formation of anomalous structures in two deep-water North-European basins are similar. A possible approach to answering this question is mathematical modeling, which allows one to follow the evolution of the anomalies. The first step on this way is the most close to the reality model reconstruction of the thermohaline water structure. The article attempts to assess whether the results of the numerical simulation with high spatial resolution are adequate to observation-based features of the vertical thermohaline structure in Lofoten and Greenland basins.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bloshkina, Ekaterina Vladimirovna</author><author>Makhotin, Mikhail S.</author><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Koldunov, N.

One way of quantifying this energy exchange is through the use of “wind work,” or the work done on the ocean by the wind. Since wind work is calculated according to the interaction between ocean surface currents and surface wind stress, a number of surface current decompositions can be used to decompose wind work calculations. In this research, geostrophic, ageostrophic, Ekman, and total current decompositions are all used to calculate wind work. Geostrophic currents are formed by the balance of surface pressure gradients and the Coriolis effect. Ageostrophic currents, on the other hand, are difficult to calculate because they are made up of many types of currents, and are generally defined as any current not in geostrophic balance. The main component of ageostrophic currents, Ekman currents, are used in this work to approximate ageostrophic currents. Ekman currents are formed by the balance of surface wind stress and the Coriolis effect. Finally, total currents are the sum of all currents in the ocean. Using high resolution, global NASA ocean models, the wind work on the global oceans is estimated via a number of decompositions, with results finding about 3.2 TW, .32 TW, and 3.05 TW for total, geostrophic, and Ekman wind work respectively, when taking a 7 day window average of surface currents and a 1 day average of surface stress. Averaging period for currents is found to significantly affect the resulting calculated wind work, with greater than 50 percent difference between 1 and 15 days of averaging. Looking at the same total, geostrophic, and Ekman wind work results for 1 day averages of wind stress and surface currents finds 5.5 TW, .03 TW, and 6.3 TW respectively. This result indicates that high frequency currents are very important to wind work. Seasonally, wind work is found to be at a maximum during the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer, and at a minimum during the NH winter months. To help motivate the funding of a Doppler Scatterometer, simulations are used to show the capabilities of such an instrument in measuring wind work. DopplerScat simulations find that a satellite capable of measuring coincident surface vector winds and surface vector currents, with 1.1 m/s wind speed error and .5 m/s current speed error, could estimate global wind work to within 2 percent accuracy on an 8 day average with daily global snapshots.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jinbo</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Gille, Sarah T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of the Kerguelen Plateau on the ocean circulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical OceanographyJournal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical OceanographyJournal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><isbn>0022-3670</isbn><notes>Wang, J., Mazloff, M.

The time-varying vorticity, planetary and relative vorticity advection, and bottom pressure torque are calculated in a two-dimensional array in the eddy-rich Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ). Bottom pressure torque is also estimated at sites across Drake Passage. Mean and eddy nonlinear relative vorticity advection terms dominate over linear advection in the local (50-km scale) vorticity budget in the PFZ, and are balanced to first order by the divergence of horizontal velocity. Most of this divergence comes from the ageostrophic gradient flow, which also provides a second-order adjustment to the geostrophic relative vorticity advection. Bottom pressure torque is approximately one-third the size of the local depth-integrated divergence. Although the cDrake velocity fields exhibit significant turning with depth throughout Drake Passage even in the mean, surface vorticity advection provides a reasonable representation of the depth-integrated vorticity balance. Observed near-bottom currents are strongly topographically steered, and bottom pressure torques grow large where strong near-bottom flows cross steep topography at small angles. Upslope flow over the northern continental slope dominates the bottom pressure torque in cDrake, and the mean across this Drake Passage transect, 3 to 4{\texttimes}10-9 m s-2, exceeds the mean wind stress curl by a factor of 15{\textendash}20.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abernathey, Ryan P</author><author>Cerovecki, Ivana</author><author>Holland, Paul R</author><author>Newsom, Emily</author><author>Mazloff, Matt</author><author>Talley, Lynne D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water-mass transformation by sea ice in the upper branch of the Southern Ocean overturning</title></titles><periodical/><pages>-</pages><volume>advance on</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><isbn>1752-0908</isbn><notes>Abernathey, R.

A Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) is analyzed over the 2005{\textendash}2010 time period in the Amundsen Sea region. The SOSE oceanic heat budget reveals that the contribution of parameterized small-scale mixing to the heat content of the ASE waters is small compared to advection and local air-sea heat flux, both of which contribute significantly to the heat content of the ASE waters. Above the permanent pycnocline, the local air-sea flux dominates the heat budget and is controlled by seasonal changes in sea ice coverage. Overall, between 2005 and 2010, the model shows a net heating in the surface above the pycnocline within the ASE. Sea water below the permanent pycnocline is isolated from the influence of air-sea heat fluxes, and thus, the divergence of heat advection is the major contributor to increased oceanic heat content of these waters. Oceanic transport of mass and heat into the ASE is dominated by the cross-shelf input and is primarily geostrophic below the permanent pycnocline. Diagnosis of the time-mean SOSE vorticity budget along the continental shelf slope indicates that the cross-shelf transport is sustained by vorticity input from the localized wind-stress curl over the shelf break.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Boening, Carmen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid variability of Antarctic Bottom Water transport into the Pacific Ocean inferred from GRACE</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>3822{\textendash}3829</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing and electromagnetic processes</keyword><keyword>antarctic bottom water</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>water masses</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016GL068474</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mazloff, M.

These waters convect and spread to fill the global abyssal oceans. The heat and carbon storage capacity of these water masses, combined with their abyssal residence times that often exceed centuries, makes this circulation pathway the most efficient sequestering mechanism on Earth. Yet monitoring this pathway has proven challenging due to the nature of the formation processes and the depth of the circulation. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity mission is providing a time series of ocean mass redistribution and offers a transformative view of the abyssal circulation. Here we use the GRACE measurements to infer, for the first time, a 2003{\textendash}2014 time series of Antarctic Bottom Water export into the South Pacific. We find this export highly variable, with a standard deviation of 1.87~sverdrup (Sv) and a decorrelation timescale of less than 1~month. A significant trend is undetectable.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Erickson, Zachary K</author><author>Thompson, Andrew F</author><author>Cassar, Nicolas</author><author>Sprintall, Janet</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An advective mechanism for Deep Chlorophyll Maxima formation in southern Drake Passage</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>n/a{\textendash}n/a</pages><keywords><keyword>Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>Physical and biogeochemical interactions</keyword><keyword>Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>biophysical interactions</keyword><keyword>continental shelf and slope processes</keyword><keyword>deep chlorophyll maximum</keyword><keyword>eddy transport</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016GL070565</electronic-resource-num><notes>Erickson, Z.

Backscatter measurements indicate that the Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCMs) are also deep biomass maxima, and euphotic depth estimates show that they lie below the euphotic layer. Sub-surface, off-shore and near-surface, on-shore features lie along the same isopycnal, suggesting advective generation of DCMs. Temperature measurements indicate a warming of surface waters throughout austral summer, capping the Winter Water (WW) layer and increasing off-shelf stratification in this isopycnal layer. The outcrop position of the WW isopycnal layer shifts onshore, into a surface phytoplankton bloom. A lateral potential vorticity (PV) gradient develops, such that a down-gradient PV flux is consistent with offshore, along-isopycnal tracer transport. Model results are consistent with this mechanism. Subduction of chlorophyll and biomass along isopycnals represents a biological term not observed by surface satellite measurements which may contribute significantly to the strength of the biological pump in this region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sallée, J.-B.</author><author>Mazloff, M</author><author>Meredith, M P</author><author>Hughes, C W</author><author>Rintoul, S</author><author>Gomez, R</author><author>Metzl, N</author><author>Monaco, C Lo</author><author>Schmidtko, S</author><author>Mata, M M</author><author>W\r ahlin, A</author><author>Swart, S</author><author>Williams, M J M</author><author>Naveria-Garabata, A C</author><author>Monteiro, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Southern Ocean in State of the Climate in 2015</title><secondary-title>Bull.

This thesis combines global models and paleoceanographic observations to con- strain the ocean’s role in storing and transporting heat, salt, and other tracers during this time, with implications for understanding how the modern ocean works and how it might change in the future. • By combining a kinematic ocean model with “upstream” and “downstream” deglacial oxygen isotope time series from benthic and planktonic foraminifera, I show that the data are in agreement with the modern circulation, quantify their power to infer circu- lation changes, and propose new data locations. • An ocean general circulation model (the MITgcm) constrained to fit LGM sea surface temperature proxy observations reveals colder ocean temperatures, greater sea ice ex- tent, and changes in ocean mixed layer depth, and suggests that some features in the data are not robust. • A sensitivity analysis in the MITgcm demonstrates that changes in winds or in ocean turbulent transport can explain the hypothesis that the boundary between deep At- lantic waters originating from Northern and Southern Hemispheres was shallower at the LGM than it is today.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balmaseda, M A</author><author>Hernandez, F</author><author>Storto, A</author><author>Palmer, M D</author><author>Alves, O</author><author>Shi, L</author><author>Smith, G C</author><author>Toyoda, T</author><author>Valdivieso, M</author><author>Barnier, B</author><author>Behringer, D</author><author>Boyer, T</author><author>Chang, Y S</author><author>Chepurin, G A</author><author>Ferry, N</author><author>Forget, G</author><author>Fujii, Y</author><author>Good, S</author><author>Guinehut, S</author><author>Haines, K</author><author>Ishikawa, Y</author><author>Keeley, S</author><author>Köhl, A</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Martin, M J</author><author>Masina, S</author><author>Masuda, S</author><author>Meyssignac, B</author><author>Mogensen, K</author><author>Parent, L</author><author>Peterson, K A</author><author>Tang, Y M</author><author>Yin, Y</author><author>Vernieres, G</author><author>Wang, X</author><author>Waters, J</author><author>Wedd, R</author><author>Wang, O</author><author>Xue, Y</author><author>Chevallier, M</author><author>Lemieux, J F</author><author>Dupont, F</author><author>Kuragano, T</author><author>Kamachi, M</author><author>Awaji, T</author><author>Caltabiano, A</author><author>Wilmer-Becker, K</author><author>Gaillard, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Ocean Reanalyses Intercomparison Project (ORA-IP)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Operational Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Operational Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>s80-s97</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>sup1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/1755876X.2015.1022329</electronic-resource-num><notes>Balmaseda, M.

In particular, so-called self-attraction and loading (SAL) effects caused by the redistribution of mass within the land?atmosphere?ocean system can have a measurable impact on sea level. In this study, the nature of SAL-induced variability in sea level is examined in terms of its equilibrium (static) and nonequilibrium (dynamic) components, using a general circulation model that implicitly includes the physics of SAL. The additional SAL forcing is derived by decomposing ocean mass anomalies into spherical harmonics and then applying Love numbers to infer associated crustal displacements and gravitational shifts. This implementation of SAL physics incurs only a relatively small computational cost. Effects of SAL on sea level amount to about 10% of the applied surface loading on average but depend strongly on location. The dynamic component exhibits large-scale basinwide patterns, with considerable contributions from subweekly time scales. Departures from equilibrium decrease toward longer time scales but are not totally negligible in many places. Ocean modeling studies should benefit from using a dynamical implementation of SAL as used here.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Wang, Ou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vertical Structure of Ocean Pressure Variations with Application to Satellite-Gravimetric Observations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>603-613</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JTECH-D-14-00156.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

Monthly gridded estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Release-05 and the new version 4 bidecadal ocean state estimate of the Consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) are used. Estimates of from GRACE and ECCO are generally in good agreement, providing an independent measure of the quality of both products. Diagnostic fields from the state estimate are used to compute barotropic (depth independent) and baroclinic (depth dependent) components. The relative roles of baroclinic and barotropic processes are found to vary with latitude and time scale: variations in at higher latitudes and shorter periods are affected by barotropic processes, whereas fluctuations at lower latitudes and longer periods can be influenced by baroclinic effects, broadly consistent with theoretical scaling arguments. Wind-driven Rossby waves and coupling of baroclinic and barotropic modes due to flow?topography interactions appear to be important influences on the baroclinic variability. Decadal simulations of monthly variability based on purely barotropic frameworks are expected to be in error by about 30% on average ( in the tropical ocean and at higher latitudes). Results have implications for applying GRACE observations to problems such as estimating transports of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, G</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Ponte, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO): Advancing CLIVAR Science</title><secondary-title>CLIVAR Exchanges</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CLIVAR Exchanges</full-title></periodical><pages>41-45</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><notes>Forget, G., Fukumori, I., Heimbach, P., Lee, T., Menemenlis, D., &amp;amp; Ponte, R.

Salinity anomalies on density surfaces from Argo float profiles are used to investigate horizontal stirring and estimate eddy mixing lengths. Eddy mixing length and velocity fluctuations from the ECCO2 global state estimate are used to estimate horizontal diffusivity at a 300?km scale in the upper 2000?m with near-global coverage. Diffusivity varies by over two orders of magnitude with latitude, longitude, and depth. In all basins, diffusivity is elevated in zonal bands corresponding to strong current regions, including western boundary current extension regions, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and equatorial current systems. The estimated mixing lengths and diffusivities provide an observationally based data set that can be used to test and constrain predictions and parameterizations of eddy stirring.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whitefield, Jonathan</author><author>Winsor, Peter</author><author>McClelland, James</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A new river discharge and river temperature climatology data set for the pan-Arctic region</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>88</volume><keywords><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>Climatology</keyword><keyword>Heat content</keyword><keyword>Modelling</keyword><keyword>River discharge</keyword><keyword>Sea ice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2014.12.012</electronic-resource-num><notes>Whitefield, J., Winsor, P., McClelland, J., &amp;amp; Menemenlis, D.

We introduce a new climatological data set of river discharge and river water temperature with 1/6° grid spacing over the Arctic region (Arctic River Discharge and Temperature; ARDAT), incorporating observations from 30 Arctic rivers. The annual mean discharge for all rivers in ARDAT is 2817 ± 330 km3 yr−1. River water temperatures range between 0 °C in winter to 14.0–17.6 °C in July, leading to a long-term mean monthly heat flux from all rivers of 3.2 ± 0.6 TW, of which 31% is supplied by Alaskan rivers and 69% is supplied by Eurasian rivers. This riverine heat flux is equivalent to 44% of the estimated ocean heat flux associated with the Bering Strait throughflow, but during the spring freshet can be ∼10 times as large, suggesting that heat flux associated with Arctic rivers is an important component of the Arctic heat budget on seasonal time scales. We apply the ARDAT data set to a high-resolution regional ocean-ice model, and compare results to a model integration using a 1° resolution discharge data set. Integrated freshwater content on the Arctic shelves (&lt;200 m) increases by ∼3600 km3 in the ARDAT forced model run compared to the coarser forcing, suggesting that river discharge is contained on the Arctic shelves when forced with the ARDAT data set. Modelled summer heat fluxes over the shelves increase by 8 TW when river water temperature is included, which subsequently reduces basin-wide September sea ice extent by ∼10%. Regional differences are larger, where e.g., sea ice extent on the Beaufort shelf is reduced by ∼36%. Using a non-linear free surface parameterization along with the ARDAT data set, we find an increase in the sea surface height gradient around river mouths. Geostrophic velocities increase to form quasi-continuous, fast-moving near-shore boundary currents not reproduced using the 1° resolution data set. Omitting river water temperature, or using a lower resolution data set, can therefore lead to incorrect model estimates of coastal transport, sea ice formation/melt rates, and other regional and basin scale processes. Using a high-resolution discharge data set, and accounting for the considerable heat carried by the Arctic rivers is recommended for future modelling efforts.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCaffrey, Katherine</author><author>Fox-Kemper, Baylor</author><author>Forget, Gael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimates of ocean macroturbulence: Structure function and spectral slope from Argo profiling floats</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1773-1793</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-14-0023.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>McCaffrey, K., B.

This study uses Argo temperature and salinity data to form the tracer structure function of ocean variability at the macroscale (10–1000 km, mesoscale and above). Here, second-order temperature and salinity structure functions over horizontal separations are calculated along either pressure or potential density surfaces, which allows analysis of both active and passive tracer structure functions. Using Argo data, a map of global variance is created from the climatological average and each datum. When turbulence is homogeneous, the structure function slope from Argo can be related to the wavenumber spectrum slope in ocean temperature or salinity variability. This first application of structure function techniques to Argo data gives physically meaningful results based on bootstrapped confidence intervals, showing geographical dependence of the structure functions with slopes near ⅔ on average, independent of depth.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buckley, Martha W</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determining the origins of advective heat transport convergence variability in the North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3943-3956</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Ekman pumping/transport</keyword><keyword>Forcing</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>Rossby waves</keyword><keyword>Sea surface temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00579.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Buckley, M.

Anomalies in (linear) advective heat transport convergences, as well as Ekman and geostrophic contributions, are decomposed into parts that are due to velocity variability, temperature variability, and their covariability. Ekman convergences are generally dominated by variability in Ekman mass transports, which reflect the instantaneous response to local wind forcing, except in the tropics, where variability in the temperature field plays a significant role. In contrast, both budget analyses and simple dynamical arguments demonstrate that geostrophic heat transport convergences that are due to temperature and velocity variability are anticorrelated, and thus their separate treatment is not insightful. In the interior of the subtropical gyre, the sum of air–sea heat fluxes and Ekman heat transport convergences is a reasonable measure of local atmospheric forcing, and such forcing explains the majority of H variability on all time scales resolved by ECCO. In contrast, in the Gulf Stream region and subpolar gyre, ocean dynamics are found to be important in setting H on interannual time scales. Air–sea heat fluxes damp anomalies created by the ocean and thus are not set by local atmospheric variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, G</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Hill, C N</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECCO version 4: an integrated framework for non-linear inverse modeling and global ocean state estimation</title><secondary-title>Geosci.

Using a dynamically consistent state estimate, the redistribution of heat within the ocean is calculated over a 20-yr period. The 20-yr mean vertical heat flux shows strong variations in both the lateral and vertical directions, consistent with the ocean being a dynamically active and spatially complex heat exchanger. Between mixing and advection, the two processes determining the vertical heat transport in the deep ocean, advection plays a more important role in setting the spatial patterns of vertical heat exchange and its temporal variations. The global integral of vertical heat flux shows an upward heat transport in the deep ocean, suggesting a cooling trend in the deep ocean. These results support an inference that the near-surface thermal properties of the ocean are a consequence, at least in part, of internal redistributions of heat, some of which must reflect water that has undergone long trajectories since last exposure to the atmosphere. The small residual heat exchange with the atmosphere today is unlikely to represent the interaction with an ocean that was in thermal equilibrium at the start of global warming. An analogy is drawn with carbon-14 “reservoir ages,” which range from over hundreds to a thousand years.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Blayo M.

The ocean data assimilation system in the regions including the Indian and West Pacific oceans is an endeavor motivated by this goal. In this study, we describe the system in detail. Moreover, the reanalysis in the joint area of Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean (hereafter AIPOcean) constructed using multi-year model integration with data assimilation is used to test the performance of this system. The ocean model is an eddy-resolving, hybrid coordinate ocean model. Various types of observations including in-situ temperature and salinity profiles (mechanical bathythermograph, expendable bathythermograph, Array for Real-time Geostrophic Oceanography, Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Array, conductivity-temperature-depth, station data), remotely-sensed sea surface temperature, and altimetry sea level anomalies, are assimilated into the reanalysis via the ensemble optimal interpolation method. An ensemble of model states sampled from a long-term integration is allowed to change with season, rather than remaining stationary. The estimated background error covariance matrix may reasonably reflect the seasonality and anisotropy. We evaluate the performance of AIPOcean during the period 1993-2006 by comparisons with independent observations, and some reanalysis products. We show that AIPOcean reduces the errors of subsurface temperature and salinity, and reproduces mesoscale eddies. In contrast to ECCO and SODA products, AIPOcean captures the interannual variability and linear trend of sea level anomalies very well. AIPOcean also shows a good consistency with tide gauges.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Wang, Ou</author><author>Llovel, William</author><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Forget, Gael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A near-uniform fluctuation of ocean bottom pressure and sea level across the deep ocean basins of the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas</title><secondary-title>Progress in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Progress in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>152-172</pages><volume>134</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pocean.2015.01.013</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., O.

The variation extends across the interconnected deep ocean basins of these semi-enclosed Arctic seas, collectively called the Arctic Mediterranean, with spatially near-uniform amplitude and phase. The basin-wide fluctuation is barotropic and dominates the region’s large-scale variability from sub-monthly to interannual timescales. The fluctuation results from bifurcating coastally trapped waves generated by winds along the continental slopes of the Arctic Mediterranean and its neighboring seas, including the North Atlantic Ocean. The winds drive Ekman transport across the large bathymetric gradients, forcing mass divergence between the shallow coastal area and the deep ocean basins and creating ocean bottom pressure anomalies of opposite signs in the two regions. The anomalies rapidly propagate away as barotropic coastally trapped waves with the coast and continental slope as respective boundaries. The waves subsequently bifurcate at the shallow straits connecting the Arctic Mediterranean with the rest of the globe. The straits transmit the shallow anomalies but not the deep variations, thereby inhibiting the anomalies’ mutual cancelation by geographically separating the two. Anomalies that enter the deep Arctic basins equilibrate uniformly across the domain characterized by a homogeneous depth-integrated planetary potential vorticity distribution. The potential vorticity’s steep gradient that borders the basins shields the region from neighboring shallow variations, giving rise to the observed spatially confined fluctuation. Compensating anomalies outside the Arctic adjust similarly across the rest of the globe but are comparatively negligible in amplitude because of the global ocean’s larger area relative to that of the deep Arctic Mediterranean. The study, from a technical perspective, illustrates the utility of a model’s adjoint in identifying causal mechanisms underlying a complex system.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Quinn, Katherine J</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Tamisiea, Mark E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of self-attraction and loading on Earth rotation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>4510-4521</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>1218 Mass balance</keyword><keyword>1223 Ocean/Earth/atmosphere/hydrosphere/cryosphere</keyword><keyword>1239 Earth rotation variations</keyword><keyword>Earth rotation</keyword><keyword>length of day</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>self-attraction and loading</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JB011980</electronic-resource-num><notes>Quinn, K.

We estimate Earth rotation excitations using models of atmospheric, oceanic, and land hydrology surface mass variations and investigate the importance of including SAL over monthly to interannual timescales. We assess SAL effects in comparison with simple mass balance effects where net mass exchanged with the atmosphere and land is distributed uniformly over the global ocean. For oceanic polar motion excitations, SAL impacts are important even though mass balance impact is minor except at the annual period. This is true of global (atmosphere + land + ocean) polar motion excitations as well, although the SAL impacts are smaller. When estimating length-of-day excitations, mass balance effects have a dominant impact, particularly for oceanic excitation. Although SAL can have a significant impact on estimated Earth rotation excitations, its consideration generally did not improve comparisons with geodetic observations. This result may change in the future as surface mass models and Earth rotation observations improve.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brix, Holger</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Hill, Christopher N.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Jahn, Oliver</author><author>Wang, D</author><author>Bowman, Kevin W.</author><author>Zhang, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Green’s Functions to initialize and adjust a global, eddying ocean biogeochemistry general circulation model</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>95</volume><keywords><keyword>Carbon Monitoring System</keyword><keyword>Data assimilation</keyword><keyword>Green’s Function</keyword><keyword>Ocean biogeochemical circulation model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2015.07.008</electronic-resource-num><notes>Brix, H., Menemenlis, D., Hill, C.

For the oceanic part of this project, we introduce ECCO2-Darwin, a new ocean biogeochemistry general circulation model based on combining the following pre-existing components: (i) a full-depth, eddying, global-ocean configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm), (ii) an adjoint-method-based estimate of ocean circulation from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2) project, (iii) the MIT ecosystem model “Darwin”, and (iv) a marine carbon chemistry model. Air–sea gas exchange coefficients and initial conditions of dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, and oxygen are adjusted using a Green’s Functions approach in order to optimize modeled air–sea CO2 fluxes. Data constraints include observations of carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) for 2009–2010, global air–sea CO2 flux estimates, and the seasonal cycle of the Takahashi et al. (2009) Atlas. The model sensitivity experiments (or Green’s Functions) include simulations that start from different initial conditions as well as experiments that perturb air–sea gas exchange parameters and the ratio of particulate inorganic to organic carbon. The Green’s Functions approach yields a linear combination of these sensitivity experiments that minimizes model-data differences. The resulting initial conditions and gas exchange coefficients are then used to integrate the ECCO2-Darwin model forward. Despite the small number (six) of control parameters, the adjusted simulation is significantly closer to the data constraints (37% cost function reduction, i.e., reduction in the model-data difference, relative to the baseline simulation) and to independent observations (e.g., alkalinity). The adjusted air–sea gas exchange parameter differs by only 3% from the baseline value and has little impact ( − 0.1 %) on the cost function. The particulate inorganic to organic carbon ratio was increased more than threefold and reduced the cost function by 22% relative to the baseline integration, indicating a significant influence of biology on air–sea gas exchange. The largest contribution to cost reduction (35%) comes from the adjustment of initial conditions. In addition to reducing biases relative to observations, the adjusted simulation exhibits smaller model drift than the baseline. We estimate drift by integrating the model with repeated 2009 atmospheric forcing for seven years and find a volume-weighted drift reduction of, for example, 12.5% for nitrate and 30% for oxygen in the top 300 m. Although there remain several regions with large model-data discrepancies, for example, overly strong carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean, the adjusted simulation is a first step towards a more accurate representation of the ocean carbon cycle at high spatial and temporal resolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ott, Lesley E</author><author>Pawson, Steven</author><author>Collatz, George J</author><author>Gregg, Watson W</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Brix, Holger</author><author>Rousseaux, Cecile S</author><author>Bowman, Kevin W.</author><author>Liu, Junjie</author><author>Eldering, Annmarie</author><author>Gunson, Michael R</author><author>Kawa, Stephan R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the magnitude of CO2 flux uncertainty in atmospheric CO2 records using products from NASA's Carbon Monitoring Flux Pilot Project</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</full-title></periodical><pages>734-765</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>0312 Air/sea constituent fluxes</keyword><keyword>0315 Biosphere/atmosphere interactions</keyword><keyword>0322 Constituent sources and sinks</keyword><keyword>CMS</keyword><keyword>CO2</keyword><keyword>GOSAT</keyword><keyword>biosphere</keyword><keyword>modeling</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014JD022411</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ott, L.

Here we report on simulations using NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS-5) which was used to evaluate the consistency of two different sets of observationally informed land and ocean fluxes with atmospheric CO2 records. Despite the observation inputs, the average difference in annual terrestrial biosphere flux between the two land (NASA Ames Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) and CASA-Global Fire Emissions Database version 3 (GFED)) models is 1.7 Pg C for 2009–2010. Ocean models (NASA's Ocean Biogeochemical Model (NOBM) and Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Phase II (ECCO2)-Darwin) differ by 35% in their global estimates of carbon flux with particularly strong disagreement in high latitudes. Based upon combinations of terrestrial and ocean fluxes, GEOS-5 reasonably simulated the seasonal cycle observed at Northern Hemisphere surface sites and by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) while the model struggled to simulate the seasonal cycle at Southern Hemisphere surface locations. Though GEOS-5 was able to reasonably reproduce the patterns of XCO2 observed by GOSAT, it struggled to reproduce these aspects of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder observations. Despite large differences between land and ocean flux estimates, resulting differences in atmospheric mixing ratio were small, typically less than 5 ppm at the surface and 3 ppm in the XCO2 column. A statistical analysis based on the variability of observations shows that flux differences of these magnitudes are difficult to distinguish from inherent measurement variability, regardless of the measurement platform.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, C G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bottom-pressure signature of annual baroclinic Rossby waves in the northeast tropical Pacific Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>2449-2459</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>annual cycle</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>currents</keyword><keyword>eddies</keyword><keyword>ocean mass</keyword><keyword>tropical Pacific</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014jc010667</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

Focus is on a zonal section along 12 degrees N between 105 degrees W and 145 degrees W that is characterized by a strong annual cycle in sea level from satellite altimetry. Estimates of p(b) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), a state estimate produced by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium, and a linear Rossby wave model (LRWM) are used. The GRACE NTPO p(b) annual cycle shows amplitudes as large as 1 cm water equivalent. The GRACE data also evidence westward propagation that is consistent with the behavior of long mode-1 Rossby waves at this latitude, with phase increasing from east to west at a rate of approximate to 0.34 m s(-1). The ECCO and LRWM p(b) estimates corroborate the notion that GRACE reveals the p(b) signature of annual Rossby waves driven by interior wind stress curl and possibly damped by frictional processes.

Two Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2), solutions were analyzed: one with data assimilation and one without. Assimilated data included satellite observations of sea surface temperature and ocean surface topography, in which the sampling patterns were approximately uniform over the 5 years, and in situ measurements of subsurface salinity and temperature profiles, in which the sampling patterns varied considerably in space and time throughout the 5 years. Velocity measurements were not assimilated. The impact of data assimilation was considered significant when the difference between the transports computed with and without data assimilation was greater than 5.5 × 106 m3 s−1 (or 5.5 Sv; 1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1) for the EUC and greater than 5.0 Sv for the NECC. In addition, the difference of annual-mean transports computed from 3-day-averaged data was statistically significant at the 95% level. The impact of data assimilation ranged from no impact to very substantial impact when data assimilation increased the EUC transport and decreased the NECC transport. The study’s EUC results had some correspondence with other studies and no simple agreement or disagreement pattern emerged among all studies of the impact of data assimilation. No comparable study of the impact of data assimilation on the NECC has been made.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The partition of regional sea level variability</title><secondary-title>Progress in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Progress in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>173-195</pages><volume>137, Part </volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pocean.2015.06.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Forget, G., and R.

Optimal inference from the data involves appropriate partition of signal and noise, in terms of relevant scales, physical processes and forcing mechanisms. Such partition is achieved here through fitting a general circulation model to altimeter and other datasets to produce a “best” estimate of ζ variability directly forced by the atmosphere—the signal of primary interest here. In this context noise comes primarily from instrument errors and meso-scale eddies, as expected, but spatial smoothing effectively reduces this noise. A separate constraint is thus formulated to measure the fit to monthly, large-scale altimetric variability that unlike the daily, pointwise constraint shows a high signal-to-noise ratio. The estimate is explored to gain insight into dynamics, forcing, and other factors controlling ζ variability. Contributions from thermo-steric, halo-steric and bottom pressure terms are all important depending on region, but slopes of steric spectra (red) and bottom pressure spectra (white) are nearly invariant with latitude. Much ζ variability can be represented by a seasonal cycle and linear trend, plus a few EOFs that can be associated with known modes of climate variability and/or with topographic controls. Both wind and buoyancy forcing are important. The response is primarily basin-bound in nature, but uneven patterns of propagation across basin boundaries are clearly present, with the Pacific being able to affect large portions of the Indian and Atlantic basins, but the Atlantic affecting mostly the Arctic.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halkides, D J</author><author>Waliser, Duane E</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Guan, Bin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying the processes controlling intraseasonal mixed-layer temperature variability in the tropical Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>692-715</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>4223 Descriptive and regional oceanography</keyword><keyword>4231 Equatorial oceanography</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>Indian Ocean</keyword><keyword>MJO</keyword><keyword>intraseasonal</keyword><keyword>mixed-layer</keyword><keyword>temperature budget</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014JC010139</electronic-resource-num><notes>Halkides, D.

We introduce a new metric for representing spatial variability of the relative importance of processes. In general, horizontal advection is most important at the Equator. Subsurface processes and surface heat flux are more important away from the Equator, with surface heat flux being the more dominant factor. Analyses at key sites are discussed in the context of local dynamics and literature. At 0°, 80.5°E, for MLT events &gt; 2 standard deviations, ocean dynamics account for more than two thirds of the net tendency during cooling and warming phases. Zonal advection alone accounts for ∼40% of the net tendency. Moderate events (1–2 standard deviations) show more differences between events, and some are dominated by surface heat flux. At 8°S, 67°E in the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge (SCTR) area, surface heat flux accounts for ∼70% of the tendency during strong cooling and warming phases; subsurface processes linked to ML depth (MLD) deepening (shoaling) during cooling (warming) account for ∼30%. MLT is more sensitive to subsurface processes in the SCTR, due to the thin MLD, thin barrier layer and raised thermocline. Results for 8°S, 67°E support assertions by Vialard et al. (2008) not previously confirmed due to measurement error that prevented budget closure and the small number of events studied. The roles of MLD, barrier layer thickness, and thermocline depth on different timescales are examined.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, G</author><author>Ferreira, D</author><author>Liang, X</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the observability of turbulent transport rates by Argo: supporting evidence from an inversion experiment</title><secondary-title>Ocean Sci.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Sci.</full-title></periodical><pages>839-853</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/os-11-839-2015</electronic-resource-num><notes>Forget, G., D.

Model simulations of contemporary sea level that impose a geothermal flux boundary condition are becoming increasingly common. To quantify the impact of geothermal fluxes on model estimates of contemporary (1993–2010) sea level changes, two ocean circulation model experiments are compared. The two simulations are based on a global ocean state estimate, produced by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium, and differ only with regard to whether geothermal forcing is applied as a boundary condition. Geothermal forcing raises the global-mean sea level trend by 0.11 mm yr − 1 in the perturbation experiment by suppressing a cooling trend present in the baseline solution below 2000 m. The imposed forcing also affects regional sea level trends. The Southern Ocean is particularly sensitive. In this region, anomalous heat redistribution due to geothermal fluxes results in steric height trends of up to ± 1 mm yr − 1 in the perturbation experiment relative to the baseline simulation. Analysis of a passive tracer experiment suggests that the geothermal input itself is transported by horizontal diffusion, resulting in more thermal expansion over deeper ocean basins. Thermal expansion in the perturbation simulation gives rise to bottom pressure increase over shallower regions and decrease over deeper areas relative to the baseline run, consistent with mass redistribution expected for deep ocean warming. These results elucidate the influence of geothermal fluxes on sea level rise and global heat budgets in model simulations of contemporary ocean circulation and climate.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watkins, Michael M.</author><author>Wiese, David N.</author><author>Yuan, Dah-Ning</author><author>Boening, Carmen</author><author>Landerer, Felix W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved methods for observing Earth's time variable mass distribution with GRACE using spherical cap mascons</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>2648-2671</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014JB011547</electronic-resource-num><notes>Watkins, M.

The planktonic and biogeochemical dynamics of the Arctic shelves exhibit a strong variability in response to Arctic warming. In this study, we employ a biogeochemical model coupled to a pan-Arctic ocean–sea ice model (MITgcm) to elucidate the processes regulating the primary production (PP) of phytoplankton, bacterioplankton (BP), and their interactions. The model explicitly simulates and quantifies the contribution of usable dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) drained by the major circum-Arctic rivers to PP and BP in a scenario of melting sea ice (1998–2011). Model simulations suggest that, on average between 1998 and 2011, the removal of usable riverine dissolved organic nitrogen (RDON) by bacterioplankton is responsible for a ~ 26% increase in the annual BP for the whole Arctic Ocean. With respect to total PP, the model simulates an increase of ~ 8% on an annual basis and of ~ 18% in summer. Recycled ammonium is responsible for the PP increase. The recycling of RDON by bacterioplankton promotes higher BP and PP, but there is no significant temporal trend in the BP : PP ratio within the ice-free shelves over the 1998–2011 period. This suggests no significant evolution in the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy in the last decade, with a constant annual flux of RDON into the coastal ocean, although changes in RDON supply and further reduction in sea-ice cover could potentially alter this delicate balance.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ostle, Clare</author><author>Johnson, Martin</author><author>Landschützer, Peter</author><author>Schuster, Ute</author><author>Hartman, Susan</author><author>Hull, Tom</author><author>Robinson, Carol</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Net community production in the North Atlantic Ocean derived from Volunteer Observing Ship data</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>80-95</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014GB004868</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ostle, C., Johnson, M., Landschützer, P., Schuster, U., Hartman, S., Hull, T., &amp;amp; Robinson, C.

For these activities accurate predictions of sea-ice conditions are required to maintain marine safety. In an attempt at Arctic sea-ice prediction, the summer of 2010 is selected to implement an Arctic sea-ice data assimilation (DA) study. The DA system is based on a regional Arctic configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) and a local singular evolutive interpolated Kalman (LSEIK) filter to assimilate Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) sea-ice concentration operational products from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Based on comparisons with both the assimilated NSIDC SSMIS concentration and concentration data from the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility, the forecasted sea-ice edge and concentration improve upon simulations without data assimilation. By the nature of the assimilation algorithm with multivariate covariance between ice concentration and thickness, sea-ice thickness fields are also updated, and the evaluation with in situ observation shows some improvement compared to the forecast without data assimilation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Ru</author><author>Flierl, Glenn R.</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying and Interpreting Striations in a Subtropical Gyre: A Spectral Perspective</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>387-406</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-14-0038.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chen, R., Flierl, G.

The setup is created in the framework of the ECCO2 project that aims to simulate global high-resolution fields of oceanographic characteristics with linear approximation to oceanographic observations. Satellite data are used to validate several oceanographic features simulated by the model: the sea ice extent and concentration, sea level and sea surface temperature. The model is able to successfully reproduce spatial and temporal variability of sea ice characteristics and give adequate estimates of seasonal variability and trend of the sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean. Simulation of sea surface height anomalies associated with mass change is satisfactory for the Arctic Ocean regions located away from the North Pole, particularly for the Barents Sea. Simulation of sea surface temperature demonstrates good results for both interannual variability and trend. Comparison of the satellite- and model-derived data proves that the model reproduces the above mentioned oceanographic features reasonably well. Therefore, this model may be used in further studies different scientific and practical problems of the Arctic Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Masich, Jessica</author><author>Chereskin, Teresa K.</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Topographic form stress in the Southern Ocean State Estimate</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>7919-7933</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JC011143</electronic-resource-num><notes>Masich, J., Chereskin, T.

We find that most significant biases between the two datasets are precipitation, downward fluxes for both shortwave and longwave radiation. Driving by these two datasets, model results forced by CFSR shows big differences on sea ice, Atlantic water and thermohaline structure in Canada basin compared to in situ observations, with the simulated geostrophic current on isopycnal surface 20% higher than that forced by JRA25and a larger volume fluxes than that derived from SODA data. Sensitivity experiment forced by downward radiative fluxes from CFSR, which have been evaluated to be close to observed values, demonstrates comparable results to observational results. The cloud data plays a key role in modeling sea ice while freshwater flux brought by precipitation can change the heat transport of Atlantic inflow prominently and carry a further effect on sea ice in the Arctic. The overestimated precipitation in CFSR is the major for large biases of volume flux through Fram Strait, geostropic current on isopycnal surface and thermohaline structure in central Arctic. Although reanalysis wind have different resolution for the two datasets, our results indicates that it carries an ignorable effect on modeling sea ice and thermohaline structure on basin scale.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Yonggang</author><author>Wei, Zexun</author><author>Lian, Zhan</author><author>Yang, Yongzeng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development of an Ocean Current Forecast System for the South China Sea</title><secondary-title>Aquatic Procedia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aquatic Procedia</full-title></periodical><pages>157-164</pages><volume>3</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aqpro.2015.02.206</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wang, Y., Wei, Z., Lian, Z., &amp;amp; Yang, Y.

Once or twice a day, tides move seawater in and out, consecutively submerging and exposing the intertidal surface, while freshwater now and then, at moments of heavy rainfall, may enter the system from the land. Mangroves can live in these highly dynamic and demanding environmental conditions via a series of remarkable adaptations such as aerial roots (pneumatophores), specialized cells in their leaves to excrete salt and the production of buoyant seeds and fruits (propagules) that disperse at the ocean surface (i.e. hydrochory). With their dense root networks, mangroves present a natural breeding ground and nursery for juvenile fish and provide shelter to many other animal species, rendering mangrove systems ecologically invaluable. From a socio-economical point of view, these forests sustain fisheries, provide firewood and wood for charcoal and construction. They may offer coastal protection to natural disasters such as storm surges and under certain conditions against tsunami. Despite their ecological and economical value, about 40 % of original mangroves have been lost worldwide during the last 50 years due to excessive exploitation and development. Deforestation, degradation and conversion to other land uses like intensive shrimp farming and agriculture have reduced and fragmented these ecosystems at an alarming rate. Climate change, probably most pronouncedly via changes in sea level, poses another important threat. In this dissertation we investigate some understudied but important aspects of the dispersal process in mangroves, with as the main objective the reduction of parameter and model uncertainty. In this way more reliable predictions of dispersal patterns and long-term population dynamics under different climate change scenarios can be expected.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Predictability of Large-Scale , Short-Period Ocean Variability in the Philippine Sea and the Influence of Such Variability on Long-Range Acoustic Propagation</title></titles><periodical/><pages>10</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>Seattle, WA</pub-location><notes>Dushaw, B.

AMOC magnitude is an important ingredient in present day climate. Previous studies have hypothesized abrupt reduction in AMOC magnitude in response to influxes of glacial melt water into the North Atlantic. Notable fresh-water influxes are associated with the terminus of the last ice age. During this period large volumes of melt water accumulated behind retreating ice sheets and subsequently drained rapidly when the ice weakened sufficiently. Rapid draining of glacial lakes into the North Atlantic is a possible origin of a number of paleo-record abrupt climate shifts. These include the Younger-Dryas cooling event and the 8,200 year cooling event. The studies undertaken focused on whether the mechanistic sequence by which glacial melt-water impacts AMOC, which then impacts Northern Hemisphere global mean surface temperature, is dynamically plausible. The work has implications for better understanding past climate stability. The work also has relevance for today’s environment, in which high-latitude ice melting in Greenland appears to be driving fresh water outflows at an accelerating pace.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ron, Cyril</author><author>Vondrák, Jan</author><author>Chapanov, Yavor</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Tsvetkov, M.

We found that if the numerical integration of Brzezinski broad-band Liouville equations of atmo- spheric/oceanic excitations is re-initialized at the epochs of geomagnetic jerks, the agreement between the integrated and observed celestial pole offsets is improved (Vondrák &amp; Ron 2014). Nevertheless, this approach assumes that the influence of geomagnetic jerks leads to a stepwise change in the position of celestial pole, which is physically not acceptable. Therefore we in- troduce a simple continuous excitation function that hypothetically describes the influence of geomagnetic jerks, and leads to rapid but continuous changes of pole position. The results of numerical integration of atmospheric/oceanic excitations plus this newly introduced excitation are then compared with the observed celestial pole offsets, and prove that the agreement is improved significantly.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bogusz, Janusz</author><author>Brzezinski, Aleksander</author><author>Kosek, Wieslaw</author><author>Nastula, Jolanta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Earth rotation and geodynamics</title><secondary-title>Geodesy and Cartography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geodesy and Cartography</full-title></periodical><pages>201-242</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1515/geocart-2015-0013</electronic-resource-num><notes>Bogusz, J., Brzezinski, A., Kosek, W., &amp;amp; Nastula, J.

The harsh environment and relative data scarcity make it difficult to characterize even the physical properties. Here, we seek a mechanistic interpretation for the rate of air-sea gas exchange (k) derived from radon-deficits. These require an estimate of the water column history extending 30 days prior to sampling. We used coarse resolution (36km) regional configuration of the MITgcm with fine near surface vertical spacing (2m) to evaluate the capability of the model to reproduce conditions prior to sampling. The model is used to estimates sea-ice velocity, concentration and mixed-layer depth experienced by the water column .We then compared the model results to existing field data including satellite, moorings and Ice-tethered profilers. We found that sea- ice coverage have 88 to 98% accuracy, sea-ice velocities have 78% correlation which resulted in 2 km/day error in 30 day trajectory of sea-ice. Model showed the capacity to capture mixed layer evolution trends although with a bias and water velocities showed only 29% correlation with actual data. Using the capacity of the model to produce same order of magnitude of water speed we calculated an average radius of possible origins of water parcel equal to 10.3 km.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stroh, J.

A wind-driven, spatially coherent mode of nonseasonal, depth-independent variability in the Canadian inland seas (i.e., the collective of Hudson Bay, James Bay, and Foxe Basin) is identified based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) retrievals, a tide-gauge record, and a barotropic model over 2003–2013. This dominant mode of nonseasonal variability is correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation and is associated with net flows into and out of the Canadian inland seas; the anomalous inflows and outflows, which are reflected in mean sea level and bottom pressure changes, are driven by wind stress anomalies over Hudson Strait, probably related to wind setup, as well as over the northern North Atlantic Ocean, possibly mediated by various wave mechanisms. The mode is also associated with mass redistribution within the Canadian inland seas, reflecting linear response to local wind stress variations under the combined influences of rotation, gravity, and variable bottom topography. Results exemplify the usefulness of GRACE for studying regional ocean circulation and climate.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dorman, Jeffrey G.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Root, Terry Louise</author><author>Hall, Kimberly R.</author><author>Herzog, Mark P.</author><author>Howell, Christine A.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling Krill in the California Current: A 2005 Case Study</title><secondary-title>Conserving Biodiversity in a Changing Climate: Linking Science and Management in Conservation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Conserving Biodiversity in a Changing Climate: Linking Science and Management in Conservation</full-title></periodical><pages>43-60</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>Berkeley, CA</pub-location><publisher>Univ of California Press</publisher><notes>Dorman, J.

We use a combination of satellite altimetry and\ngravity, tide gauge, river discharge, and atmospheric re-analysis data\nto provide a comprehensive up-to-date analysis of sea level variability\nin the Black Sea and to quantify the role of different environmental\nfactors that force the variability. The Black Sea is part of a\nlarge-scale climatic system that includes the Mediterranean and the\nNorth Atlantic. The seasonal sea level budget shows similar\ncontributions of fresh water fluxes (precipitation, evaporation, and\nriver discharge) and the Black Sea outflow, while the impact of the net\nsurface heat flux is smaller although not negligible. We find that the\nnonseasonal sea level time series in the Black and Aegean seas are\nsignificantly correlated, the latter leading by 1 month. This lag is\nattributed to the adjustment of sea level in the Black Sea to externally\nforced changes of sea level in the Aegean Sea and to the impact of river\ndischarge. The nonseasonal sea level budget in the Black Sea is\ndominated by precipitation and evaporation over the sea itself, but\nexternal processes such as river discharge and changes in the outflow\ncan also cause some large synoptic-scale sea level anomalies. Sea level\nis strongly coupled to terrestrial water storage over the Black Sea\ndrainage basin, which is modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation\n(NAO). We show that during the low/high NAO southwesterly/northeasterly\nwinds near the Strait of Gibraltar and southerly/northerly winds over\nthe Aegean Sea are able to dynamically increase/decrease sea level in\nthe Mediterranean and Black seas, respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tyler, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electromagnetic coupling of ocean flow with the Earth System</title><secondary-title>Terrestrial, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Terrestrial, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>41-52</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Electrodynamics</keyword><keyword>Electromagnetic coupling</keyword><keyword>Induction</keyword><keyword>Ocean flow</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3319/TAO.2014.08.19.04(GRT)</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tyler, R.

For this purpose, we developed an adjustment model which allows to combine precise observations from space geodetic observation systems, such as Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), Global Navigation Satellite Systems, Very Long Baseline Interferometry, Doppler Orbit determination and Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite, satellite altimetry and satellite gravimetry in order to separate geophysical excitation mechanisms of Earth rotation. Three polar motion time series are applied to derive the polar motion excitation functions (integral effect). Furthermore we use five time variable gravity field solutions from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment to determine not only the integral mass effect but also the oceanic and hydrological mass effects by applying suitable filter techniques and a land–ocean mask. For comparison the integral mass effect is also derived from degree 2 potential coefficients that are estimated from SLR observations. The oceanic mass effect is also determined from sea level anomalies observed by satellite altimetry by reducing the steric sea level anomalies derived from temperature and salinity fields of the oceans. Due to the combination of all geodetic estimated excitations the weaknesses of the individual processing strategies can be reduced and the technique-specific strengths can be accounted for. The formal errors of the adjusted geodetic solutions are smaller than the RMS differences of the geophysical model solutions. The improved excitation time series can be used to improve the geophysical modeling.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lüpkes, Christof</author><author>Gryanik, Vladimir M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Parameterization of drag coefficients over polar sea ice for climate models</title><secondary-title>Mercator Ocean Quarterly Newsletter</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mercator Ocean Quarterly Newsletter</full-title></periodical><pages>29-34</pages><issue>51</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><notes>Lüpkes, C., &amp;amp; Gryanik, V.

Melt ponds are a common feature in the inner Arctic during summer while drifting ice floes and their edges influence the surface roughness especially in the marginal sea ice zones during all seasons. Governing parameters in the parameterization that can be easily applied to climate models are the sea ice concentration and aspect ratio h/D where h is the ice freeboard and D is the characteristic length of floes and ponds/leads. When these parameters are not available from a sea ice model, the aspect ratios can also be parameterized as a function of the sea ice concentration so that the new schemes can also be used in stand-alone atmospheric models using observed sea ice concentration. The parameterization is evaluated for idealized meteorological forcing and prescribed sea ice and melt pond concentration in the Siberian Arctic and in parts of the Central Arctic. The required sea ice data are available from remote sensing. The distributions of drag coefficients obtained from traditional parameterizations and from the new one show large differences in this test scenario especially in the region south of 80°N.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Zeliang</author><author>Han, Guoqi</author><author>Dupont, Frederic</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of Spectral Nudging on Oceanic States in a Coarse-Resolution Model</title><secondary-title>Atmosphere-Ocean</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Atmosphere-Ocean</full-title></periodical><pages>351-362</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07055900.2015.1050352</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wang, Z., Han, G., &amp;amp; Dupont, F.

Predictive skill for steric sea level is found over large areas of the World Ocean, notably over the subtropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, along the path of the North Atlantic Current, and over the Indian and Southern Oceans. Mechanisms for the predictabilityofthethermostericandhalostericcontributionstothestericsignalare studied byseparatingthese components into signals originating from processes within and beneath the mixed layer. Contributions originating from below the mixed layer are further decomposed into density-related (isopycnal motion term) and density-compensated (spice term)changes. Inregions ofthe subtropical Pacific andAtlanticOceans, predictive skill results from the interannual variability associated with the contribution from isopycnal motion to thermostericsealevel.Skillrelatedtothermostericmixedlayerprocessesisfoundtobeimportantinthesubtropical Atlantic, while the spice contribution shows skill over the subpolar North Atlantic. In the subtropics, the high predictive skill can be rationalized in terms of westward-propagating baroclinic Rossby waves for a lead time of 2–5yr, as demonstrated using an initialized Rossby wave model. Because of the low Rossby wave speed in high latitudes, this process is not separable from the persistence there.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerovečki, Ivana</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The spatiotemporal structure of diabatic processes governing the evolution of Subantarctic Mode Water in the Southern Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical OceanographyJournal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical OceanographyJournal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><isbn>0022-3670</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-14-0243.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cerovečki, I., &amp;amp; Mazloff, M.

The parameterizations differ in the transfer coefficients for heat and freshwater fluxes. In their simplest form, they are assumed constant and hence are independent of the velocity of ocean currents at the ice shelf base. An augmented melt rate parameterization accounts for frictional turbulence via transfer coefficients that do depend on boundary layer current velocities via a drag law. In simulations with both parameterizations for idealized as well as realistic cavity geometries under Pine Island Ice Shelf, West Antarctica, significant differences in melt rate patterns between the velocity-independent and velocity-dependent formulations are found. While patterns are strongly correlated to those of thermal forcing for velocity-independent transfer coefficients, melting in the case of velocity-dependent coefficients is collocated with regions of high boundary layer currents, in particular where rapid plume outflow occurs. Both positive and negative feedbacks between melt rates, boundary layer temperature, velocities, and buoyancy fluxes are identified. Melt rates are found to increase with increasing drag coefficient Cd, in agreement with plume model simulations, but optimal values of Cd inferred from plume models are not easily transferable. Uncertainties therefore remain, both regarding simulated melt rate spatial distributions and magnitudes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Webber, B G M</author><author>Matthews, A J</author><author>Heywood, K J</author><author>Kaiser, J</author><author>Schmidtko, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seaglider observations of equatorial Indian Ocean Rossby waves associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>3714-3731</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>kelvin waves</keyword><keyword>mechanism</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>period</keyword><keyword>tropics</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>wind</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2013jc009657</electronic-resource-num><notes>Webber, B.

These high-resolution subsurface observations provide insight into equatorial ocean Rossby wave activity forced by three Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events during this time period. These Rossby waves generate variability in temperature O(1 degrees C), salinity O(0.2 g kg(-1)), density O(0.2 kg m(-3)), and oxygen concentration O(10 mu mol kg(-1)), associated with 10 m vertical displacements of the thermocline. The variability extends down to 1000 m, the greatest depth of the Seaglider observations, highlighting the importance of surface forcing for the deep equatorial ocean. The temperature variability observed by the Seaglider is greater than that simulated in the ECCO-JPL reanalysis, especially at depth. There is also marked variability in chlorophyll fluorescence at the surface and at the depth of the chlorophyll maximum. Upwelling from Rossby waves and local wind stress curl leads to an enhanced shoaling of the chlorophyll maximum by 10-25 m in response to the increased availability of nutrients and light. This influence of the MJO on primary production via equatorial ocean Rossby waves has not previously been recognized.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amos, Helen M</author><author>Jacob, Daniel J</author><author>Kocman, David</author><author>Horowitz, Hannah M</author><author>Zhang, Yanxu</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Horvat, Milena</author><author>Corbitt, Elizabeth S</author><author>Krabbenhoft, David P</author><author>Sunderland, Elsie M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Biogeochemical Implications of Mercury Discharges from Rivers and Sediment Burial</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>9514-9522</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>air-sea exchange</keyword><keyword>arctic-ocean</keyword><keyword>estuary</keyword><keyword>heavy-metals</keyword><keyword>mackenzie river</keyword><keyword>mass-balance</keyword><keyword>metal accumulation</keyword><keyword>south china</keyword><keyword>speciation</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/es502134t</electronic-resource-num><notes>Amos, H.

Based on an analysis of compiled observations, we estimate global present-day Hg discharges from rivers to ocean margins are 27 +/- 13 Mmol a(-1) (5500 +/- 2700 Mg a(-1)), of which 28% reaches the open ocean and the rest is deposited to ocean margin sediments. Globally, the source of Hg to the open ocean from rivers amounts to 30% of atmospheric inputs. This is larger than previously estimated due to accounting for elevated concentrations in Asian rivers and variability in offshore transport across different types of estuaries. Riverine inputs of Hg to the North Atlantic have decreased several-fold since the 1970s while inputs to the North Pacific have increased. These trends have large effects on Hg concentrations at ocean margins but are too small in the open ocean to explain observed declines of seawater concentrations in the North Atlantic or increases in the North Pacific. Burial of Hg in ocean margin sediments represents a major sink in the global Hg biogeochemical cycle that has not been previously considered. We find that including this sink in a fully coupled global biogeochemical box model helps to balance the large anthropogenic release of Hg from commercial products recently added to global inventories. It also implies that legacy anthropogenic Hg can be removed from active environmental cycling on a faster time scale (centuries instead of millennia). Natural environmental Hg levels are lower than previously estimated, implying a relatively larger impact from human activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vallina, S M</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Montoya, J M</author><author>Cermeno, P</author><author>Loreau, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global relationship between phytoplankton diversity and productivity in the ocean</title><secondary-title>Nature Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>4299</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, there are few observations and there has been little attempt to understand the mechanisms that would lead to such a shape for planktonic organisms. Here we use a marine ecosystem model together with the community assembly theory to explain the shape of the unimodal PDR we obtain at the global scale. The positive slope from low to intermediate productivity is due to grazer control with selective feeding, which leads to the predator-mediated coexistence of prey. The negative slope at high productivity is due to seasonal blooms of opportunist species that occur before they are regulated by grazers. The negative side is only unveiled when the temporal scale of the observation captures the transient dynamics, which are especially relevant at highly seasonal latitudes. Thus selective predation explains the positive side while transient competitive exclusion explains the negative side of the unimodal PDR curve. The phytoplankton community composition of the positive and negative sides is mostly dominated by slow-growing nutrient specialists and fast-growing nutrient opportunist species, respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Death, R</author><author>Wadham, J L</author><author>Monteiro, F</author><author>Le Brocq, A M</author><author>Tranter, M</author><author>Ridgwell, A</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Raiswell, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antarctic ice sheet fertilises the Southern Ocean</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2635-2643</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric iron deposition</keyword><keyword>cycle</keyword><keyword>dissolved iron</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>icebergs</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>primary productivity</keyword><keyword>waters</keyword><keyword>west</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-11-2635-2014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Death, R., J.

Southern Ocean (SO) marine primary productivity (PP) is strongly influenced by the availability of iron in surface waters, which is thought to exert a significant control upon atmospheric CO2 concentrations on glacial/interglacial timescales. The zone bordering the Antarctic Ice Sheet exhibits high PP and seasonal plankton blooms in response to light and variations in iron availability. The sources of iron stimulating elevated SO PP are in debate. Established contributors include dust, coastal sediments/upwelling, icebergs and sea ice. Subglacial meltwater exported at the ice margin is a more recent suggestion, arising from intense iron cycling beneath the ice sheet. Icebergs and subglacial meltwater may supply a large amount of bioavailable iron to the SO, estimated in this study at 0.07–0.2 Tg yr&amp;minus;1. Here we apply the MIT global ocean model (Follows et al., 2007) to determine the potential impact of this level of iron export from the ice sheet upon SO PP. The export of iron from the ice sheet raises modelled SO PP by up to 40%, and provides one plausible explanation for seasonally very high in situ measurements of PP in the near-coastal zone. The impact on SO PP is greatest in coastal regions, which are also areas of high measured marine PP. These results suggest that the export of Antarctic runoff and icebergs may have an important impact on SO PP and should be included in future biogeochemical modelling.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moore, Robert M</author><author>Kienast, Markus</author><author>Fraser, Michael</author><author>Cullen, John J</author><author>Deutsch, Curtis</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Somes, Christopher J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extensive hydrogen supersaturations in the western South Atlantic Ocean suggest substantial underestimation of nitrogen fixation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>4340-4350</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4820 Gases</keyword><keyword>4845 Nutrients and nutrient cycling</keyword><keyword>Atlantic Ocean</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>dissolved hydrogen</keyword><keyword>nitrogen fixation</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014JC010017</electronic-resource-num><notes>Moore, R.

Yet major uncertainties of quantification remain, particularly regarding the global oceanic nitrogen fixation rate. Hydrogen is produced during nitrogen fixation and will become supersaturated in surface waters if there is net release from diazotrophs. Ocean surveys of hydrogen supersaturation thus have the potential to illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrogen fixation and to guide the far more onerous but quantitative methods for measuring it. Here we present the first transect of high resolution measurements of hydrogen supersaturations in surface waters along a meridional 10,000 km cruise track through the Atlantic. We compare measured saturations with published measurements of nitrogen fixation rates and also with model-derived values. If the primary source of excess hydrogen is nitrogen fixation and has a hydrogen release ratio similar to Trichodesmium, our hydrogen measurements would point to similar rates of fixation in the North and South Atlantic, roughly consistent with modeled fixation rates but not with measured rates, which are lower in the south. Possible explanations would include any substantial nitrogen fixation by newly discovered diazotrophs, particularly any having a hydrogen release ratio similar to or exceeding that of Trichodesmium; undersampling of nitrogen fixation south of the equator related to excessive focus on Trichodesmium; and methodological shortcomings of nitrogen fixation techniques that cause a bias toward colonial diazotrophs relative to unicellular forms. Alternatively, our data are affected by an unknown hydrogen source that is greater in the southern half of the cruise track than the northern.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, S</author><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Nie, X W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mixed layer salinity budget in the tropical Pacific Ocean estimated by a global GCM</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>8255-8270</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>ENSO</keyword><keyword>barrier-layer</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>fresh pool</keyword><keyword>intraseasonal</keyword><keyword>salinity budget</keyword><keyword>sea-surface</keyword><keyword>simulated passive tracer</keyword><keyword>southern oscillation</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>toga decade</keyword><keyword>tropical Pacific</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>warm pool</keyword><keyword>western equatorial pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014jc010336</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gao, S., T.

The results focusing on the western Pacific freshwater pool indicate that the long-term averaged surface freshwater flux is well balanced by ocean dynamics, in which the subsurface processes account for the major part. The MLS budget shows significant seasonal and interannual variability, as a consequence of interplay among surface freshwater flux, advection, mixing, and vertical entrainment. On seasonal time scale, both the MLS and mixed layer depth are largely controlled by surface freshwater flux. The opposite phase between the subsurface processes and the barrier layer thickness confirms the important influence of the barrier layer on vertical mixing and entrainment from below. On interannual time scale, all the MLS budget terms show significant ENSO signal, which in turn is highly correlated with the salinity front and barrier layer thickness in the equatorial Pacific.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dotto, T S</author><author>Kerr, R</author><author>Mata, M M</author><author>Azaneu, M</author><author>Wainer, I</author><author>Fahrbach, E</author><author>Rohardt, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of the structure and variability of Weddell Sea water masses in distinct ocean reanalysis products</title><secondary-title>Ocean Sci.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Sci.</full-title></periodical><pages>523-546</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/os-10-523-2014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dotto, T.

(GOSAT) sampling on the estimation of terrestrial biospheric flux with the NASA Carbon Monitoring System Flux (CMS-Flux) estimation and attribution strategy. The simulated observations in the OSSE use the actual column carbon dioxide (XCO2 ) b2.9 retrieval sensitivity and quality control for the year 2010 processed through the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space algorithm. CMS-Flux is a variational inversion system that uses the GEOS-Chem forward and adjoint model forced by a suite of observationally constrained fluxes from ocean, land and anthropogenic models. We investigate the impact of GOSAT sampling on flux estimation in two aspects: 1) random error uncertainty reduction and 2) the global and regional bias in posterior flux resulted from the spatiotemporally biased GOSAT sampling. Based on Monte Carlo calculations, we find that global average flux uncertainty reduction ranges from 25% in September to 60% in July. When aggregated to the 11 land regions designated by the phase 3 of the Atmospheric Tracer Transport Model Intercomparison Project, the annual mean uncertainty reduction ranges from 10% over North American boreal to 38% over South American temperate, which is driven by observational coverage and the magnitude of prior flux uncertainty. The uncertainty reduction over the South American tropical region is 30%, even with sparse observation coverage. We show that this reduction results from the large prior flux uncertainty and the impact of non-local observations. Given the assumed prior error statistics, the degree of freedom for signal is ~1132 for 1-yr of the 74 055 GOSAT XCO2 observations, which indicates that GOSAT provides ~1132 independent pieces of information about surface fluxes. We quantify the impact of GOSAT's spatiotemporally sampling on the posterior flux, and find that a 0.7 gigatons of carbon bias in the global annual posterior flux resulted from the seasonally and diurnally biased sampling when using a diagonal prior flux error covariance.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ward, Ben A</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling spatial and temporal patterns in size-structured marine plankton communities: top–down and bottom–up controls</title><secondary-title>Journal of Plankton Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Plankton Research</full-title></periodical><pages>31-47</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/plankt/fbt097</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ward, B.

Here, we examine this theory in a more realistic context using a size-structured global ocean food-web model, together with a much simplified version of the same model for which equilibrium solutions are readily obtained. Both models include the same basic assumptions: allometric scaling of physiological traits and size-selective zooplankton grazing. According to the equilibrium model, grazing places a limit on the phytoplankton biomass within each size-class, while the supply rate of essential nutrients limits the number of coexisting size classes, and hence the total biomass, in the system. The global model remains highly consistent with this conceptual view in the large-scale, annual average sense, but reveals more complex behaviour at shorter timescales, when phytoplankton and zooplankton growth may become decoupled. In particular, we show temporal and spatial scale dependence between total phytoplankton biomass and two key ecosystem properties: the zooplankton-to-phytoplankton ratio, and the partitioning of biomass among different size classes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kalmikov, Alexander G</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Hessian-Based Method for Uncertainty Quantification in Global Ocean State Estimation</title><secondary-title>Siam Journal on Scientific Computing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Siam Journal on Scientific Computing</full-title></periodical><pages>S267-S295</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>uncertainty propagation,principal uncertainty patt</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1137/130925311</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kalmikov, A.

Marine ecosystem models used to investigate how global change affects ocean ecosystems and their functioning typically omit pelagic plankton diversity. Diversity, however, may affect functions such as primary production and their sensitivity to environmental changes. Here we use a global ocean ecosystem model that explicitly resolves phytoplankton diversity by defining subtypes within four phytoplankton functional types (PFTs). We investigate the model's ability to capture diversity effects on primary production under environmental change. An idealized scenario with a sudden reduction in vertical mixing causes diversity and primary-production changes that turn out to be largely independent of the number of coexisting phytoplankton subtypes. The way diversity is represented in the model provides a small number of niches with respect to nutrient use in accordance with the PFTs defined in the model. Increasing the number of phytoplankton subtypes increases the resolution within the niches. Diversity effects such as niche complementarity operate between, but not within PFTs, and are constrained by the variety of traits and trade-offs resolved in the model. The number and nature of the niches formulated in the model, for example via trade-offs or different PFTs, thus determines the diversity effects on ecosystem functioning captured in ocean ecosystem models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danabasoglu, Gokhan</author><author>Yeager, Steve G</author><author>Bailey, David</author><author>Behrens, Erik</author><author>Bentsen, Mats</author><author>Bi, Daohua</author><author>Biastoch, Arne</author><author>Böning, Claus</author><author>Bozec, Alexandra</author><author>Canuto, Vittorio M</author><author>Cassou, Christophe</author><author>Chassignet, Eric</author><author>Coward, Andrew C</author><author>Danilov, Sergey</author><author>Diansky, Nikolay</author><author>Drange, Helge</author><author>Farneti, Riccardo</author><author>Fernandez, Elodie</author><author>Fogli, Pier Giuseppe</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Fujii, Yosuke</author><author>Griffies, Stephen M</author><author>Gusev, Anatoly</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Howard, Armando</author><author>Jung, Thomas</author><author>Kelley, Maxwell</author><author>Large, William G</author><author>Leboissetier, Anthony</author><author>Lu, Jianhua</author><author>Madec, Gurvan</author><author>Marsland, Simon J</author><author>Masina, Simona</author><author>Navarra, Antonio</author><author>George Nurser, A J</author><author>Pirani, Anna</author><author>y Mélia, David Salas</author><author>Samuels, Bonita L</author><author>Scheinert, Markus</author><author>Sidorenko, Dmitry</author><author>Treguier, Anne-Marie</author><author>Tsujino, Hiroyuki</author><author>Uotila, Petteri</author><author>Valcke, Sophie</author><author>Voldoire, Aurore</author><author>Wang, Qiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>North Atlantic simulations in Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments phase II (CORE-II).

These experiments use inter-annually varying atmospheric forcing data sets for the 60-year period from 1948 to 2007 and are performed as contributions to the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II). The protocol for conducting such CORE-II experiments is summarized. Despite using the same atmospheric forcing, the solutions show significant differences. As most models also differ from available observations, biases in the Labrador Sea region in upper-ocean potential temperature and salinity distributions, mixed layer depths, and sea-ice cover are identified as contributors to differences in AMOC. These differences in the solutions do not suggest an obvious grouping of the models based on their ocean model lineage, their vertical coordinate representations, or surface salinity restoring strengths. Thus, the solution differences among the models are attributed primarily to use of different subgrid scale parameterizations and parameter choices as well as to differences in vertical and horizontal grid resolutions in the ocean models. Use of a wide variety of sea-ice models with diverse snow and sea-ice albedo treatments also contributes to these differences. Based on the diagnostics considered, the majority of the models appear suitable for use in studies involving the North Atlantic, but some models require dedicated development effort.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Piecuch, C G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual Bottom Pressure Signals in the Australian-Antarctic and Bellingshausen Basins</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1456-1465</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Atm/Ocean Structure/ Phenomena</keyword><keyword>Circulation/ Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Geographic location/entity</keyword><keyword>Interannual variability</keyword><keyword>Large-scale motions</keyword><keyword>Ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>Oceanic variability</keyword><keyword>Sea level</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>Variability</keyword><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>part i</keyword><keyword>resonance</keyword><keyword>sea-level variability</keyword><keyword>southeast pacific</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-13-0223.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

Consistent with the theory of Gill and Niiler, the patterns of stronger p(b) variability are partly related to enhanced local wind curl forcing and weakened gradients in H/f, where H is ocean depth and f is the Coriolis parameter. Despite weaker H/f gradients, motions against them are sufficiently strong to play a role in balancing the local wind input. Topographic effects are as or more important than changes in f. Additionally, and contrary to the dominance of barotropic processes at subannual time scales, baroclinic effects are not negligible when balancing wind input at periods of a few years. Results highlight the emerging capability to accurately observe and estimate interannual changes in large-scale p(b) over the Southern Ocean, with implications for the interpretation of low-frequency variability in sea level in terms of steric height and heat content.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seroussi, Hélène</author><author>Morlighem, M</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Mouginot, J</author><author>Larour, E</author><author>Schodlok, M</author><author>Khazendar, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sensitivity of the dynamics of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, to climate forcing for the next 50 years</title><secondary-title>The Cryosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cryosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>1699-1710</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/tc-8-1699-2014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Seroussi, H., Morlighem, M., Rignot, E., Mouginot, J., Larour, E., Schodlok, M., &amp;amp; Khazendar, A.

Owing to nonlinearities in the equation of state of seawater, the nature of processes contributing to recent observed global-mean steric sea level changes has not been well understood. Using a data-constrained ocean state estimate, global-mean steric sea level change over 1993–2003 is revisited, and contributions from ocean transports and surface exchanges are quantified using closed potential temperature and salinity budgets. Analyses demonstrate that estimated decadal global-mean steric sea level change results mainly from a slight, time-mean imbalance between atmospheric forcing and ocean transports over the integration period: surface heat and freshwater exchanges produce a trend in global-mean steric sea level that is mainly offset by the redistribution of potential temperature and salinity through small-scale diffusion and large-scale advection. A set of numerical experiments demonstrates that global-mean steric sea level changes simulated by ocean general circulation models are sensitive to the regional distribution of ocean heat and freshwater content changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sciascia, R</author><author>Cenedese, C</author><author>Nicolì, D</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Straneo, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of periodic intermediary flows on submarine melting of a Greenland glacier</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>7078-7098</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>0720 Glaciers</keyword><keyword>4203 Analytical modeling and laboratory experiment</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword><keyword>fjord dynamics</keyword><keyword>glacier melting</keyword><keyword>ice-ocean modeling</keyword><keyword>laboratory experiment</keyword><keyword>numerical model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014JC009953</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sciascia, R., C.

The idealized configurations broadly match that of Sermilik Fjord, southeast Greenland, a largely two layers system characterized by strong seasonal variability of subglacial discharge. Consistent with observations, the numerical results suggest that the intermediary circulation is an effective mechanism for the advection of shelf anomalies inside the fjord. In the numerical simulations, the advection mechanism is a density intrusion with a velocity which is an order of magnitude larger than the velocities associated with a glacier-driven circulation. In summer, submarine melting is mostly influenced by the discharge of surface runoff at the base of the glacier and the intermediary circulation induces small changes in submarine melting. In winter, on the other hand, submarine melting depends only on the water properties and velocity distribution at the glacier front. Hence, the properties of the waters advected by the intermediary circulation to the glacier front are found to be the primary control of the submarine melting. When the density of the intrusion is intermediate between those found in the fjord's two layers, there is a significant reduction in submarine melting. On the other hand, when the density is close to that of the bottom layer, only a slight reduction in submarine melting is observed. The numerical results compare favorably to idealized laboratory experiments with a similar setup.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wortham, C</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Multidimensional Spectral Description of Ocean Variability</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>944-966</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Altimetry</keyword><keyword>Circulation</keyword><keyword>Climatology</keyword><keyword>Dynamics</keyword><keyword>Kinetic energy</keyword><keyword>Mathematical and statistical techniques</keyword><keyword>Observational techniques and algorithms</keyword><keyword>Oceanic variability</keyword><keyword>Physical Meteorology and</keyword><keyword>Rossby waves</keyword><keyword>Spectral analysis</keyword><keyword>Variability</keyword><keyword>baroclinic</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>dispersion-relation</keyword><keyword>distribution</keyword><keyword>evolution</keyword><keyword>extratropical planetary-waves</keyword><keyword>kinetic-energy</keyword><keyword>mean flow</keyword><keyword>models</keyword><keyword>number spectrum</keyword><keyword>quasi-geostrophic theory</keyword><keyword>rossby waves</keyword><keyword>rough</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-13-0113.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wortham, C., &amp;amp; Wunsch, C.

The spectrum model spans periods longer than the inertial but shorter than a decade and wavelengths between 100 and 10 000 km. Assuming geostrophic dynamics, a spectrum model for the streamfunction is constructed to be consistent with a range of observations, including sea surface height from satellite altimetry, velocity from moored and shipboard instruments, and temperature from moorings. First-order characteristics of the observed spectra, including amplitude and spectral moments, vary slowly geographically. The spectrum model is horizontally anisotropic, accommodating observations that zonal wavenumber-frequency spectra are dominated by a nondispersive line. Qualitative and quantitative agreement is found with one-dimensional frequency and wavenumber spectra and observed vertical profiles of variance. Illustrative application is made of the model spectrum to observing-system design, data mapping, and uncertainty estimation for trends.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Azaneu, M</author><author>Kerr, R</author><author>Mata, M M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of the representation of Antarctic Bottom Water properties in the ECCO2 reanalysis</title><secondary-title>Ocean Sci.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Sci.</full-title></periodical><pages>923-946</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/os-10-923-2014</electronic-resource-num><notes>Azaneu, M., Kerr, R., &amp;amp; Mata, M.

Using a least squares fit of a full general circulation and sea ice model to upper-ocean proxy data with specified error estimates, a seasonally varying reconstruction is sought of the Atlantic Ocean state that is consistent with both the known dynamics and the data. With reasonable uncertainty assumptions for the observations and the adjustable (control) variables, a consistent LGM ocean state is found, one not radically different from the modern one. Inferred changes include a strengthening of the easterly and westerly winds, leading to strengthened subtropical and subpolar gyres, and increased upwelling favorable winds off the coast of Africa, leading to particularly cold SSTs in those regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, N T</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Wang, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating satellite salinity errors for assimilation of Aquarius and SMOS data into climate models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>4732-4744</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>performance</keyword><keyword>sea-surface salinity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014jc009906</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vinogradova, N.

Here such errors are derived by comparing satellite SSS observations from Aquarius and SMOS with ocean model output and in situ data. The associated data error variance maps have a complex spatial pattern, ranging from less than 0.05 in the open ocean to 1-2 (units of salinity variance) along the coasts and high latitude regions. Comparing the data-model misfits to the data errors indicates that the Aquarius and SMOS constraints could potentially affect estimated SSS values in several ocean regions, including most tropical latitudes. In reference to the Aquarius error budget, derived errors are less than the total allocation errors for the Aquarius mission accuracy requirements in low and midlatitudes, but exceed allocation errors in high latitudes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antipodal acoustic thermometry: 1960, 2004</title><secondary-title>Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers</full-title></periodical><pages>1-20</pages><volume>86</volume><keywords><keyword>Acoustic tomography</keyword><keyword>Antipodal acoustics</keyword><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Ocean modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dsr.2013.12.008</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dushaw, B.

The recorded travel time of these signals, about 13,375 s, is a historical measure of the ocean temperature averaged across several ocean basins. The 1960 travel time measurement has about 3-s precision. High-resolution global ocean state estimates for 2004 from the “Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II” (ECCO2) project were combined with ray tracing to determine the paths followed by the acoustic signals. The acoustic paths are refracted geodesics that are slightly deflected by either small-scale topographic features in the Southern Ocean or the coast of Brazil. The refractive influences of intense, small-scale oceanographic features, such as Agulhas Rings or eddies in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, greatly reduce the necessary topographic deflection and cause the acoustic paths to meander in time. The ECCO2 ocean state estimates, which are constrained by model dynamics and available data, were used to compute present-day travel times. Measured and computed arrival coda were in good agreement. Based on recent estimates of warming of the upper ocean, the travel-time change over the past half-century was nominally expected to be about −9 s, but little difference between measured (1960) and computed (2004) travel times was found. Taking into account uncertainties in the 1960 measurements, the 2004 ocean state estimates, and other approximations, the ocean temperature averaged along the sound channel axis over the antipodal paths has warmed at a rate less than about 4.6 m °C yr−1 (95% confidence).

The higher-resolution reanalyses (on the order of 1/4 degrees X 1/4 degrees) are better at reproducing the circulation pattern in the subpolar gyre than those with lower resolution (on the order of 1 degrees). Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) and Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO)-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) produce transports at 26 degrees N that are close to those observed [17 Sv (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1))]. ECCO, version 2, and SODA produce northward transports across the GSR (observed transport of 8.2 Sv) that are 22% and 29% too big, respectively. By contrast, the low-resolution reanalyses have transports that are either too small [by 31% for ECCO-JPL and 49% for Ocean Reanalysis, system 3 (ORA-S3)] or much too large [Decadal Prediction System (DePreSys)]. SODA had the best simulations of mixed layer depth and with two coarse grid long-term reanalyses (DePreSys and ORA-S3) is used to examine changes in North Atlantic circulation from 1960 to 2008. Its results suggest that the AMOC increased by about 20% at 26 degrees N while transport across the GSR hardly altered. The other (less reliable) long-term reanalyses also had small changes across the GSR but changes of +10% and -20%, respectively, at 26 degrees N. Thus, it appears that changes in the overturning circulation at 26 degrees N are decoupled from the flow across the GSR. It is recommended that transport observations should not be assimilated in ocean reanalyses but used for validation instead.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buckley, Martha W</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Low-Frequency SST and Upper-Ocean Heat Content Variability in the North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>4996-5018</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00316.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Buckley, M.

However, other variables such as winds, precipitation, and radiation show large spreads. The magnitude of uncertainties in all fields is large when compared to the signal.

The success of EIFEX owes to the applied experimental strategy; namely to use the closed core of a mesoscale eddy for the iron injection. This strategy not only allowed tracking the phytoplankton bloom within the fertilized patch of mixed-layer water, but also allowed the export of biologically fixed carbon to the deep ocean to be quantified. In this present study, least-squares techniques are used to fit a regional numerical ocean circulation model with four open boundaries to temperature, salinity, and velocity observations collected during EIFEX. By adjusting the open boundary values of temperature, salinity and velocity, an optimized model is obtained that clearly improves the simulated eddy and its mixed layer compared to a first guess representation of the cyclonic eddy. A biogeochemical model, coupled to the optimized circulation model, simulates the evolution of variables such as chlorophyll a and particular organic carbon in close agreement with the observations. The estimated carbon export, however, is lower than the estimates obtained from observations without numerical modeling support. Tuning the sinking parameterization in the model increases the carbon export at the cost of unrealistically high sinking velocities. Repeating the model experiment without adding iron allows more insight into the effects of the iron fertilization. In the model this effect is about 40% lower than in previous estimates in the context of EIFEX. The likely causes for these discrepancies are potentially too high remineralization, inaccurate representation of the bloom-termination in the model, and ambiguity in budget computations and averaging. The discrepancies are discussed and improvements are suggested for the parameterization used in the biogeochemical model components.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bidecadal Thermal Changes in the Abyssal Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2013-2030</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>argo program</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>estimation</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>level rise</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic ocean</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>state</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-13-096.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., &amp;amp; Heimbach, P.

Interpretation requires close attention to the long memory of the deep ocean, implying that meteorological forcing of decades to thousands of years ago should still be producing trendlike changes in abyssal heat content. Much of the deep-ocean volume remained unobserved. At the present time, warming is seen in the deep western Atlantic and Southern Oceans, roughly consistent with those regions of the ocean expected to display the earliest responses to surface disturbances. Parts of the deeper ocean, below 3600 m, show cooling. Most of the variation in the abyssal Pacific Ocean is comparatively featureless, consistent with the slow, diffusive approach to a steady state expected there. In the global average, changes in heat content below 2000 m are roughly 10% of those inferred for the upper ocean over the 20-yr period. A useful global observing strategy for detecting future change has to be designed to account for the different time and spatial scales manifested in the observed changes. If the precision estimates of heat content change are independent of systematic errors, determining oceanic heat uptake values equivalent to 0.1 W m(-2) is possibly attainable over future bidecadal periods.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Straneo, F</author><author>Sergienko, O</author><author>Hamilton, G</author><author>Office, U S CLIVAR Project</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>International workshop on understanding the response of Greenlands marine-terminating glaciers to oceanic and atmospheric forcing: Challenges to improving observations, process understanding and modeling</title></titles><periodical/><pages>36</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>Washington D.

Current formulations of active prey-switching, however, display non-maximal feeding in which the predators' total ingestion decays exponentially with the number prey species (i.e. the diet breadth) even though the total prey biomass stays constant. We analyse three previously published multi-species functional responses which have either active switching or maximal feeding, but not both. We identify the cause of this apparent incompatibility and describe a kill-the-winner formulation that combines active switching with maximal feeding. Active switching is shown to be a community response in which some predators become preyselective and the formulations with maximal or non-maximal feeding are implicitly assuming different food web configurations. Global simulations using a marine ecosystem model with 64 phytoplankton species belonging to 4 major functional groups show that the species richness and biogeography of phytoplankton are very sensitive to the choice of the functional response for grazing. The phytoplankton biogeography reflects the balance between the competitive abilities for nutrient uptake and the degree of apparent competition which occurs indirectly between species that share a common predator species. The phytoplankton diversity significantly increases when active switching is combined with maximal feeding through predator-mediated coexistence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Interactions are divided into local and nonlocal. If all the energy released from the mean flow through eddy–mean flow interaction is used to support eddy growth in the same region, or if all the energy released from eddies through eddy–mean flow interaction is used to feed back to the mean flow in the same region, eddy–mean flow interaction is local; otherwise, it is nonlocal. Different regions have different characters: in the subtropical region studied in detail, interactions are dominantly local. In the Southern Ocean and Kuroshio and Gulf Stream Extension regions, they are mainly nonlocal. Geographical variability of dominant eddy–eddy and eddy–mean flow processes is a dominant factor in understanding ocean energetics.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwon, Young Oh</author><author>Frankignoul, Claude</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of multidecadal atlantic meridional overturning circulation variability diagnosed in depth versus density space</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>9359-9376</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate variability</keyword><keyword>Meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>Multidecadal variability</keyword><keyword>North Atlantic Ocean</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Thermocline circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0038201110402</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00228.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kwon, Y.

The red noise-like multi-decadal AMOC variability is primarily forced by the surface fluxes associated with stochastic changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) that intensify and shift northward the deep convection in the Labrador Sea. However, the persistence of the AMOC and the associated oceanic anomalies that are directly forced by the NAO forcing does not exceed about 5 years. The additional persistence originates from anomalous horizontal advection and vertical mixing, which generate density anomalies on the continental shelf along the eastern boundary of the subpolar gyre. These anomalies are subsequently advected by the mean boundary current into the northern part of the Labrador Sea convection region, reinforcing the density changes directly forced by the NAO. As no evidence was found of a clear two-way coupling with the atmosphere, the multi-decadal AMOC variability in the last 250 years of the integration is an ocean-only response to stochastic NAO forcing with a delayed positive feedback caused by the changes in the horizontal ocean circulation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sánchez, L.</author><author>Dayoub, N.</author><author>Čunderlík, R.</author><author>Minarechová, Z.</author><author>Mikula, K.</author><author>Vatrt, V.</author><author>Vojtíšková, M.</author><author>Šíma, Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>W0 Estimates in the Frame of the GGOS Working Group on Vertical Datum Standardisation</title></titles><periodical/><pages>203-210</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-10837-7_26</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sánchez, L., Dayoub, N., Čunderlík, R., Minarechová, Z., Mikula, K., Vatrt, V., … Šíma, Z.

Permitting and reasonably safe execution of these activities in ice-infested waters require risk assessments that stretch the limits of currently available oil spill trajectory models. Research has suggested that using a coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean model to simulate oil spill trajectories in ice-infested waters could provide higher accuracy than traditionally parameterized models. This study is a first step towards the development of such a model within the framework of the MIT general circulation model. Oil spills are simulated by continuous release of passive tracers at ten locations in the Arctic Ocean Basin, and tracked in the ocean and sea ice for one year starting at the end of the drilling season, using classical parameterizations to model oil-ice interaction. Trajectories in sea ice are compared to historical sea ice drift data and found to agree reasonably well. 31 simulations with differing sets of historical environmental forcing are carried out to quantify inter-annual variability. Sensitivity to the key parameter, fraction of ice coverage, is found to be low. In general it is concluded that, depending on location, oil spills may be advected up to ∼1,700km over a winter season and ∼3,500km over one year. The furthest advection of spilled oil is observed in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, Baffin Bay, and East Greenland. Oil spills originating in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Barents Seas are confirmed to cross international boundaries, and all spills are found to have potentially severe impact on coastlines. Where mobile drift ice is present, transport with sea ice is more extensive than transport with ocean currents.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Landschützer, Peter</author><author>Gruber, N.</author><author>Bakker, D.

The Totten Glacier is rapidly losing mass. It has been suggested that this mass loss is driven by changes in oceanic forcing; however, the details of the ice–ocean interaction are unknown. Here we present results from an ice shelf–ocean model of the region that includes the Totten, Dalton and Moscow University ice shelves, based on the Regional Oceanic Modeling System for the period 1992–2007. Simulated area-averaged basal melt rates (net basal mass loss) for the Totten and Dalton ice shelves are 9.1 m ice yr−1 (44.5 Gt ice yr−1) and 10.1 m ice yr−1 (46.6 Gt ice yr−1), respectively. The melting of the ice shelves varies strongly on seasonal and interannual timescales. Basal melting (mass loss) from the Totten ice shelf spans a range of 5.7 m ice yr−1 (28 Gt ice yr−1) on interannual timescales and 3.4 m ice yr−1 (17 Gt ice yr−1) on seasonal timescales. This study links basal melt of the Totten and Dalton ice shelves to warm water intrusions across the continental shelf break and atmosphere–ocean heat exchange. Totten ice shelf melting is high when the nearby Dalton polynya interannual strength is below average, and vice versa. Melting of the Dalton ice shelf is primarily controlled by the strength of warm water intrusions across the Dalton rise and into the ice shelf cavity. During periods of strong westward coastal current flow, Dalton melt water flows directly under the Totten ice shelf further reducing melting. This is the first such modelling study of this region to provide a valuable framework for directing future observational and modelling efforts.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Elipot, Shane</author><author>Frajka-Williams, Eleanor</author><author>Hughes, Chris W.</author><author>Willis, Josh K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Observed North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: Its Meridional Coherence and Ocean Bottom Pressure</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>517-537</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-13-026.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Elipot, S., Frajka-Williams, E., Hughes, C.

At the southern termination of the continental shelf, most of the current turns back to the Indian Ocean in the Agulhas Return Current, this is called the Agulhas retroflection. In this process some eddies are shed from the current and propagate westward in the Atlantic Ocean. The water that originates from the Indian Ocean and enters the South Atlantic Ocean is called the Agulhas leakage. It is believed that this flux of relatively warm and salty water plays an important role in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. In this thesis the dynamics of the retroflection process is studied. A new regime of retroflection is found for highly turbulent flows. In this regime the volume of leakage reaches a maximum and stays unchanged while both the wind stress curl and the Agulhas Current transport increase. This is found to be due to an increase of the interactions with the northern branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The importance of the Indonesian Throughflow, the equatorial flux of water from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean, is also explored using numerical models. It is shown that it leads to strengthen the leakage but does not change the proportion of retroflection. On the way from the Indonesian Through flow to the Agulhas Current an important passage is the South East Madagascar Current. Using dynamic topography data from satellite altimetry, dipolar structures are found to form continuously at the southern tip of Madagascar. The perturbations induced by these structures contributed to the two early retroflections of the Agulhas Current observed over the last 20 years. Finally, a method is developed and validated to measure the Agulhas leakage volume transport from satellite altimetry data.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olhsson, Elizabeth Halley</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Capturing the Impact of Riverine Nutrient Delivery on Coastal Ocean Biogeochemistry</title></titles><periodical/><pages>168</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><notes>Olhsson, E.

Does it matter? Do sub-grid-scale rivers have significant impacts on offshore primary productivity? Using the Eel River in northern California, the river with the largest sediment yield per drainage area in the continental United States, as a test case, this question is explored using two approaches. First, a data-driven analysis of relevant time series taken on land, by buoy, and from space, demonstrates very little evidence of direct impact of Eel River discharge on contemporaneous coastal ocean primary productivity – but to the extent that that evidence exists, it seems to occur during years of greatest river discharge. To further analyze mechanistic drivers, a coupled mesoscale modeling framework unifying ocean, watershed and atmospheric representations is formulated and run in hindcast over the 2002-2010 period. Monthly average climatologies, interannual variabilities, and event-driven analysis of each year’s largest river discharge are all examined for evidence of a river-ocean connection expressed through primary production. Storm event-generated turbulence appears to dominate the primary productivity during the winter months. The impact of the river seems to be largely independent of nutrient load, because its dissolved nitrate is less than that of the coastal ocean. There is no evidence that riverine delivery of gradually bioavailable detritus has a significant effect. Although a sufficiently super-nitrous river shows the ability to sustain a plume-nutrient-driven-bloom even at periods of extremely low flow, this is not currently a realistic scenario for the Eel River. The possibility remains that another micronutrient not studied in the modeling framework, such as iron, could be important to this system.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sánchez-Drewes, Laura Marlene</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A uniform vertical reference system for South America as part of a global elevation system</title></titles><periodical/><pages>165</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><notes>Sánchez-Drewes, L.

The following topics are discussed: a) Definition and realisation of a conventional global vertical reference system; b) Review and standardisation of the geodetic data referring to the South American height systems; c) Strategies for the precise transformation of the local height datums into the global vertical reference system. It is expected that a modern vertical reference system supports the combination of physical and geometric heights with high accuracy globally. Therefore, two components are considered: a) A geometric component consisting of ellipsoidal heights as coordinates and a level ellipsoid as the reference surface, and b) A physical component comprising geopotential numbers as coordinates and an equipotential surface defined by a conventional W0 value as the reference surface. The definition of the physical component is based on potential parameters in order to provide reference to any type of physical heights (normal, orthometric, etc.). The conversion of geopotential numbers into metric heights and the modelling of the reference surface (geoid or quasigeoid determination) are considered as steps of the realisation. Since the approach developed in this study is based on the combination of geometric and physical parameters, it was necessary to include an inventory of the standards used in the determination of the vertical coordinates. This inventory is the basis for the identification and consequent removal of systematic errors caused by the application of different models and methods in the generation of the data available for this study. The main results of this study are: a) A detailed description of the characteristics to be satisfied by the reference stations realising the global vertical reference system. This description includes the needed conventions for the standardisation of the vertical coordinates and the computation of normal equations for the national levelling networks. These equations are required to integrate the local height systems into the global one. b) Estimation of the reference value W0 following different approaches and applying the latest geodetic models of the Earth\'s surface and gravity field. This procedure also includes a rigorous error propagation analysis to assess the reliability of the W0 estimate. c) Observation equations for the determination of the level discrepancies between the local height datums and the global W0. This is performed in three approaches: in the ocean areas around the reference tide gauges (ocean approach), at the reference tide gauges (coastal approach), and at the reference stations of the geocentric reference system (continental approach). d) Vertical datum parameters for the unification of the South American height systems into a global vertical reference system. The accuracy is assessed to be about ±5 cm for those countries with a good coverage of measurements (Argentina, Brazil-Imbituba, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela). For those regions with poor data coverage or high uncertainties in the data quality (Brazil-Santana, Bolivia, Peru, and Chile), the accuracy is estimated to be about ±2 … 3 dm. The obtained level differences are in general positive, i.e., local vertical datums are above the global reference level W0. This and the north-south increase along the Atlantic coast and the south-north increase along the Pacific coast reflect well the behaviour of the sea surface topography in these regions. e) A description of the further activities to be developed by each country to improve the results of this study.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Childers, Katelin</author><author>Flagg, Charles N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Circulation and Transport Across the Iceland Faroes Shetland Ridge</title><secondary-title>Marine and Atmospheric Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine and Atmospheric Science</full-title></periodical><pages>122</pages><volume>Ph.D.</volume><issue>3684409</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>Ann Arbor</pub-location><publisher>State University of New York at Stony Brook</publisher><notes>Childers, K., &amp;amp; Flagg, C.

This dissertation presents the spatial and temporal characteristics of the currents crossing the ridge from both an observational and modeling perspective. Previous analyses of the volume flux across the ridge have relied on moored velocity data and standard hydrographic sections. A unique velocity dataset collected weekly by the M/F Norrona along repeated routes significantly improves the spatial resolution of observations between Iceland and Denmark. Output from a global climate model complements this work by establishing the mean circulation between the observational sections. Following an introduction in Chapter 1, an analysis of the first 4.5 years of weekly observational data collected by the Norrona program is presented in Chapter 2. Surface inflows enter over the eastern half of each section and transport 1.5&amp;plusmn; 0.19 and 4.6&amp;plusmn; 0.46 Sv through the Faroe Shetland Channel (FSC) and across the Iceland Faroes Ridge (IFR), respectively. Fluctuations in the FSC inflows depend primarily on the southward flux over the Faroe shelf and slope, while the inflow width drives IFR interannual variability. The description of regional circulation is expanded southward in Chapter 3, using historic data from an additional ship of opportunity. Inflow paths from the North Atlantic Current to the Nordic Seas are presented. Output from a high resolution (1/12&lt;super&gt;o&lt;/super&gt;), hourly, data assimilating run of the ECCO2 configuration of the MITgcm enhances the description of the mean flow between the observational routes and offers insight into the mesoscale features which perturb the time averaged circulation in Chapter 4. A streamline analysis in Chapter 5, predicts the flow paths from the IFR around the north of the Faroes and into the FSC. The recirculation of Atlantic Water onto the Faroes shelf and slope is shown to be split between a larger component (~1 Sv) , which is entrained into the Shetland Slope Current over the eastern FSC, and a smaller flow (~0.5 Sv), which circulates anticyclonically around the Faroes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holland, Paul R.</author><author>Bruneau, Nicolas</author><author>Enright, Clare</author><author>Losch, Martin</author><author>Kurtz, Nathan T.</author><author>Kwok, Ron</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeled Trends in Antarctic Sea Ice Thickness</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3784-3801</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00301.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Holland, P.

Two-equation turbulence closure models are argued to be an optimal compromise between efficiency and accuracy for the purpose of calculating diapycnal fluxes of momenturn, heat and tracers in coastal ocean modelling. They provide enough degrees of freedom to be calibrated to the most prominent properties of coastal ocean mixing, but are still numerically robust and computationally efficient. Isopycnal mixing schemes are briefly reviewed as well. Major implementational and numerical aspects are presented, with some focus on the inherent problem of numerically-induced mixing which together with the physically-induced mixing gives the effective mixing in ocean models. Vertically adaptive coordinates are presented as one possibility to reduce numerical mixing. Finally, three coastal ocean simulation examples from the General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM) which is coupled to the turbulence module of the General Ocean Turbulence Model . (GOTM) are given. These examples include thermocline mixing in the Northern North Sea, physically and numerically induced mixing in the Western Baltic Sea as well as basinwide mixing in the Central Baltic Sea. All three examples highlight the importance of using well-calibrated turbulence closure models together with vertically adaptive coordinates.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sánchez-Drewes, Laura Marlene</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A unified vertical reference system for South America within a global elevation system</title></titles><periodical/><pages>165</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><notes>Sánchez-Drewes, L.

Previous inferences of deep ocean temperature and salinity from sediment pore fluid oxygen isotopes and chlorinity indicate that the deep ocean density structure at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ∼20,000 years BP) was set by salinity, and that the density contrast between northern and southern sourced deep waters was markedly greater than in the modern ocean. High density stratification could help explain the marked contrast in carbon isotope distribution recorded in the LGM ocean relative to that we observe today, but what made the ocean’s density structure so different at the LGM? How did it evolve from one state to another? Further, given the sparsity of the LGM temperature and salinity data set, what else can we learn by increasing the spatial density of proxy records? We investigate the cause and feasibility of a highly and salinity stratified deep ocean at the LGM and we work to increase the amount of information we can glean about the past ocean from pore fluid profiles of oxygen isotopes and chloride. Using a coupled ocean– sea ice–ice shelf cavity model we test whether the deep ocean density structure at the LGM can be explained by ice–ocean interactions over the Antarctic continental shelves, and show that a large contribution of the LGM salinity stratification can be explained through lower ocean temperature. In order to extract the maximum information from pore fluid profiles of oxygen isotopes and chloride we evaluate several inverse methods for ill-posed problems and their ability to recover bottom water histories from sediment pore fluid profiles. We demonstrate that Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation techniques enable us to robustly recover the full solution space of bottom water histories, not only at the LGM, but through the most recent deglaciation and the Holocene up to the present. Finally, we evaluate a non-destructive pore fluid sampling technique, Rhizon samplers, in comparison to traditional squeezing methods and show that despite their promise, Rhizons are unlikely to be a good sampling tool for pore fluid measurements of oxygen isotopes and chloride.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kenitz, Katarzyna M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The paradox of the plankton: Investigating the effect of inter-species competition of phytoplankton and its sensitivity to nutrient supply and external forcing</title></titles><periodical/><pages>270</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><notes>Kenitz, K.

High biodiversity has been explained in terms of the phytoplankton system not reaching an equilibrium state. Spatial and temporal variability can be achieved through externally imposed physical variability or internally-induced behaviour including periodic oscillations or irregular, chaotic behaviour. The research presented in this thesis investigates whether the non-equilibrium, chaotic response of the phytoplankton community is a likely outcome within the aquatic ecosystems. The thesis addresses the extent that chaotic behaviour remains a robust response with externally-imposed environmental variability. The sparsity of long-term time-series data and infrequent sampling inhibits the ability to verify whether marine ecosystems exhibit complex behaviour. The analysis of the timeseries records of phytoplankton taxa in the English Channel suggests that chaos might occur within diatom and dinoflagellates abundance time series. However, simulations using a chemostat model for phytoplankton and nutrients suggests that time series sampled every 1-2 days for more than 5 years are required to confidently distinguish deterministic chaos from noise. The model simulations suggest that the community response depends on the phytoplankton requirement for nutrients and attributed physiological traits allowing each species to be a stronger competitor for a different resource. A wider inter-species specialization increases the likelihood of oscillatory and chaotic responses, with competitive exclusion decreasing from 50% to 20% of the cases. Higher departures from the Redfield ratio in the elemental composition of species favour complex community behaviour and act to increase biodiversity. Whether chaotic response can be sustained is sensitive to the strength of the diffusive feedback between nutrient supply and ambient nutrient concentration that acts to sustain steady-state nutrient concentrations. Including seasonal and stochastic variability in the nutrient supply reveals that the frequency of chaotic dynamics increases by 20% and 45% respectively. In addition, seasonal forcing leads to temporal variability in the strength of the chaotic response, with chaos becoming more prevalent in the summer. In contrast to a well-mixed, homogeneous environment, physical dispersal can stir different phytoplankton communities together, which might act to inhibit chaos, but at the same time enhance phytoplankton diversity. Idealised model simulations are conducted to mimic the small and large scale transport processes by including 2 or 3 well-mixed boxes. Locally generated chaotic response is sustained if: 1) there is a low rate of exchange with a strong nutrient competitor that maintains the contrasts in the community structure; 2) a strong competitor is inhibited by a high mortality rate. In addition, if the local community is outcompeted, chaos can be exported through the advection of stronger competitors that exhibit chaotic fluctuations. This study highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between ambient nutrients and phytoplankton community. The variability in the nutrient supply and connectivity between ecosystems shape the community response to inter-species competition. Complex behaviour arising from inter-species competition is suggested to have a significant contribution in driving biodiversity. Future research on assessing the extent of chaos requires extending and analysing the available time-series data obtained from stable or isolated marine provinces.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Landschützer, Peter</author><author>Gruber, N.</author><author>Bakker, D.C.E.</author><author>Schuster, U.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An observation-based global monthly gridded sea surface pCO2 product from 1998 through 2011 and its monthly climatology</title></titles><periodical/><pages>3</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>Oak Ridge, Tennessee</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.3334/CDIAC/OTG.SPCO2_1998_2011_ETH_SOM-FFN</electronic-resource-num><notes>Landschützer, P., Gruber, N., Bakker, D.

From those, air–sea CO 2 flux maps are computed using a standard gas exchange parameterization and high–resolution wind speeds. Observations form the basis of the studies conducted in this thesis. The neural net- work estimates benefit from a continuous improvement of the observations, i.e., the Sur- face Ocean CO 2 Atlas (SOCAT) database. Additionally, bottle samples were collected along the UK–Caribbean line to investigate the variability of the sea surface pCO 2 and its drivers. The neural network derived pCO 2 estimates fit the observed pCO 2 data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 10 μatm in the Atlantic Ocean from 1998 through 2007 and about 12 μatm in the global ocean from 1998 through 2011, with almost no bias in both studies. A check against independent pCO 2 data reveals a larger RMSE, in particular in regions with strong pCO 2 variability and gradients. Temporal mean contemporary flux estimates for the Atlantic Ocean (–0.45±0.15 Pg C · yr −1 ) and the global ocean (–1.54±0.65 Pg C · yr −1 ) agree well with recent studies. Trends and variabilities within the considered time periods are strongly influenced by climate modes. The global results from 1998 through 2011 reveal the strongest variability of the air–sea CO 2 fluxes in the Equatorial Pacific (±0.12 Pg C · yr −1 , ±1σ), mainly driven by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate mode. Trends towards a strengthening of the Southern Ocean carbon sink (–0.36±0.07 Pg C · yr −1 · decade −1 ) from 1998 through 2011 are potentially linked to the recent weakening of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, Joanne</author><author>Hughes, C.

We use ocean bottom-pressure measurements from 17 tropical sites to determine the annual cycle of ocean mass. We show that such a calculation is robust, and use three methods to estimate errors in the mass determination. Our final best estimate, using data from the best sites and two ocean models, is that the annual cycle has an amplitude of 0.85 mbar (equivalent to 8.4 mm of sea level, or 3100 Gt of water), with a 95% chance of lying within the range 0.61–1.17 mbar. The time of the peak in ocean mass is 10 October, with 95% chance of occurring between 21 September and 25 October. The simultaneous fitting of annual ocean mass also improves the fitting of bottom-pressure instrument drift.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Belonenko, T V</author><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Norden, Y E</author><author>Ozhigin, V K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water Circulation in the Lofoten Basin of the Norwegian Sea</title><secondary-title>St. Petersburg University Bulletin.

Th is large topographic depression with a maximum depth of 3250 m located in the Norwegian sea is associated with amplifi cation of EKE (eddy kinetic energy) and has some peculiar features of the circulation pattern. Quasi-permanent vortex in the center of the basin is studied with data from ECCO2 eddy-permitting circulation model, altimeter data and trajectories of ARGO buoys. In this study a comprehensive review of all the surveys related to the circulation in LB for the last 50 years is presented in order to structure knowledge and supplement it with the results of new research. Th e data used in this paper confi rm that general water movement in LB is cyclonic along the boundaries of the basin with the distinguishing anticyclonic vortex in the center of the basin. Th e explanation of this phenomenon is a subject for future research.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Polkova, Iuliia</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of initialization procedures on the predictive skill of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model</title><secondary-title>Climate Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>3151-3169</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>11-12</issue><keywords><keyword>Anomaly initialization</keyword><keyword>Decadal predictions</keyword><keyword>Flux correction</keyword><keyword>Full state initialization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00382-013-1969-4</electronic-resource-num><notes>Polkova, I., Köhl, A., &amp;amp; Stammer, D.

An understanding of such will enable us to determine whether certain climate signals can have an impact on polar motion. Here we have compared regional patterns of three surficial fluids: the atmosphere, ocean and land-based hydrosphere. The oceanic excitation function of polar motion was estimated with the ECCO/JPL data-assimilating model, and the atmo- spheric excitation function was determined from NCEP/NCAR reanalyses. The excitation function due to land hydrology was estimated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data by an indirect approach that determines water thickness. Our attention focuses on the regional distribution of atmospheric and oceanic excitation of the annual and Chandler wobbles during 1993–2010, and on hydrologic excitation of these wobbles during 2002.9–2011.5. It is found that the regions of maximum fractional covariance (those exceeding a value of 3 · 10 3 ) for the annual band are over south Asia, southeast Asia and south central Indian ocean, for hydrology, atmosphere and ocean respectively; and for the Chandler period, areas over North America, Asia, and southern South America; and scattered across the southern oceans for the atmosphere and oceans respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blunden, Jessica</author><author>Arndt, Derek S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State of the Climate in 2013</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>S1-S279</pages><volume>95</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2014BAMSStateoftheClimate.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Blunden, J., &amp;amp; Arndt, D.

Knowledge of these processes is important from both a local and a global perspective. Globally, because the export of cold and low saline water and sea ice might influence the North Atlantic and global merid- ional overturning circulation. Locally, because freshwater processes affect the vertical stratification and permit favorable conditions for the ice cover. Models of different complexity are the main tools of the present work. A part of the material considers how these models can be used to examine the key processes governing freshwater balance. Additionally, the freshwater budgets amongst 10 different ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) are compared and robust features and weaknesses identified. A large part considers the freshwater processes governing the stratifica- tion with an emphasis on the low saline upper parts. The interactions between freshwater sources and sinks are studied in an OGCM using passive tracers. It is found that the composition, pathways and shelf-basin exchange of low saline water primarily involve processes linked to Siberian runoff, Pacific wa- ter and sea-ice melting and formation. Motivated by observed changes and paleorecords the sensitivity of the stratification is further explored in fresh- water perturbation experiments with an OGCM. The response yields a deeper halocline for decreasing freshwater input, in line with a theoretical model. The final part focuses on a new framework for analyzing water mass trans- formations. In the framework volume, heat and salt budgets are computed in salinity-temperature space. Using different OGCMs it is shown how surface and interior processes transform inflowing waters towards colder and fresher waters and how the halocline renewal rate can be estimated. Limiting cases for the water mass transformation balance are identified by separating contri- butions from surface, internal and boundary fluxes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Agarwal, Neeraj</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Mechoso, Carlos Roberto</author><author>Stammer, Detlaf</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Early Response of the Climate System to a Meltwater Input from Greenland</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>8276-8296</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00762.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Agarwal, N., Köhl, A., Mechoso, C.

We have produced and made accessible 9 years (2002–2010) of the pCO2sea at 0.5 degree resolutions daily over the global ocean. The data were used to reveal multi-year and regional variability of pCO2sea in relation to ocean parameters.

Here the partition between barotropic and baroclinic flow in the time-mean ACC is investigated in a Southern Ocean state estimate. The zonal geostrophic transport is predominantly baroclinic, with at most 25% of the transport at any longitude carried by the barotropic component. Following surface streamlines, changes in vertical shear and near-bottom velocity are large, and result in changes in the local partition of barotropic/baroclinic vertically integrated transport from 10/90% in the center of the basins, to 50/50% near complex topography. The velocity at depth is not aligned with the surface velocity. This nonequivalent barotropic flow supports significant cross-stream transports. Barotropic and baroclinic mass transport across the ACC is, on average, in opposite directions, with the net barotropic cross-stream transport being poleward and the net baroclinic equatorward. The sum partially cancels out, leaving a net geostrophic poleward transport across the different fronts between -5 and -20 Sv. Temperature is also transported across the fronts by the nonequivalent barotropic part of the ACC, with maximum values across the northern ACC fronts equivalent to -0.2 PW. The sign and magnitude of these transports are not sensitive to the choice of stream-coordinate. These cross-stream volume and temperature transports are variable in space, and dependent on the interactions between deep flow and bathymetry, thus difficult to infer from surface and hydrographic observations alone.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Worcester, P F</author><author>Dzieciuch, M A</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the time-mean state of ocean models and the properties of long range acoustic propagation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>4346-4362</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4259 Ocean acoustics</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>acoustic thermometry</keyword><keyword>model testing</keyword><keyword>ocean models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgrc.20325</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dushaw, B.

Predictions for arrival patterns using annual average WOA05 fields match observations to within small travel time offsets (0.3–1.0 s). Predictions for arrival patterns from the models differ substantially from the measured arrival patterns, from the WOA05 climatology, and from each other, both in terms of travel time and in the structure of the arrival patterns. The acoustic arrival patterns are sensitive to the vertical gradients of sound speed that govern acoustic propagation. Basin-scale acoustic transmissions, therefore, provide stringent tests of the vertical temperature structure of ocean state estimates. This structure ultimately influences the mixing between the surface waters and the ocean interior. The relatively good agreement of the acoustic data with the more recent ECCO solutions indicates that numerical ocean models have reached a level of accuracy where the acoustic data can provide useful additional constraints for ocean state estimation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Wang, Ou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Origins of heat and freshwater anomalies underlying regional decadal sea level trends</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>563-567</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>1641 Sea level change</keyword><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4263 Ocean predictability and prediction</keyword><keyword>4513 Decadal ocean variability</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>sea level rise</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/grl.50164</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., and O.

The results reveal that most salinity maximum water in the North Atlantic comes from the northwestern part of the subtropical gyre, and direct contribution from the evaporation-precipitation maximum region via the surface Ekman current is minor. Water originating from the evaporation-precipitation maximum region has to recirculate in the subtropical gyre before entering the sea surface salinity maximum region from the northwest. Once subducted, some portion (similar to 10%) of the salinity maximum water enters the equatorial region in the shallow subtropical cell, but most (similar to 70%) of it appears to turn northward to join the North Atlantic Deep Water. The latter pathway involves a three-dimensional circulation. When the warm, fresh surface water flows northward along the western boundary, it turns eastward in the northern subtropical gyre. As a result of the large excess of evaporation over precipitation, this water gradually gains its salinity on the route, until it reaches the sea surface salinity maximum region in the central subtropical gyre. From there, the salinity maximum water is subducted and flows back to the western boundary in the depth range of the thermocline.

Typ- ically, uncertainty estimates are made by a variety of ad hoc methods, often based on numerical model results or the variability of the data set being analyzed. We provide a systematic approach based on the four-dimensional frequency-wavenumber spec- trum of low-frequency ocean variability. This thesis presents an empirical model of the spectrum of ocean variability for periods between about 20 days and 15 years and wavelengths of about 200–10,000 km, and describes applications to ocean circulation trend detection, observing system design, and satellite data processing. The horizontal wavenumber-frequency part of the model spectrum is based on satellite altimetry, current meter data, moored temperature records, and shipboard ADCP data. The spectrum is dominated by motions along a “nondispersive line”. The observations considered are consistent with a universal ω −2 power law at the high end of the frequency range, but inconsistent with a universal wavenumber power law. The model spectrum is globally varying and accounts for changes in dominant phase speed, period, and wavelength with location. The vertical structure of the model spectrum is based on numerical model results, current meter data, and theo- retical considerations. We find that the vertical structure of kinetic energy is surface intensified relative to the simplest theoretical predictions. We present a theory for the interaction of linear Rossby waves with rough topography; rough topography can explain both the observed phase speeds and vertical structure of variability. The improved description of low-frequency ocean variability presented here will serve as a useful tool for future oceanographic studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Baroclinic Motions and Energetics as Measured by Altimeters</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>140-150</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Eddies,Tides,Satellite observations,Baroclinic mod</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JTECH-D-12-00035.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2013: Baroclinic Motions and Energetics as Measured by Altimeters.

Those deflections are a small fraction of the interior isopycnal vertical displacements and are dependent directly upon the in situ stratification. Conversion of surface height to interior amplitudes and energies encounters significant spatial and seasonal shifts that need to be accounted for in quantitative use. This technical article analyzes the global-scale spatial variations in the relationship between surface deflections and interior motions. Similar considerations make it possible to use altimetric data to estimate the deep interior temperature variability as a function of position, calculations having a strong influence on abyssal trend determination in the presence of eddies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ward, Ben A</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Moore, C Mark</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Iron, phosphorus, and nitrogen supply ratios define the biogeography of nitrogen fixation</title><secondary-title>Limnology and Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Limnology and Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2059-2075</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4319/lo.2013.58.6.2059</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ward, B.

The theory explains the global biogeography of diazotrophs and the observed large-scale variations in surface ocean nutrient concentrations. The ratios in which N, P, and Fe are delivered to the surface ocean, relative to the demands of the phytoplankton community, define several biogeochemical provinces in terms of the limiting nutrients and the presence or absence of diazotrophs. Nutrient supply ratios provided by a global ecosystem model support the theoretical view that diazotroph biogeography is dominated by the Fe : N supply ratio, with the P : N supply ratio taking an important secondary role. The theory yields robust predictions for which strong empirical support is found in global observations of surface nutrient concentrations and diazotroph abundance.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrographic Preconditioning for Seasonal Sea Ice Anomalies in the Labrador Sea</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>863-883</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>baffin-bay</keyword><keyword>boundary-layer</keyword><keyword>cover</keyword><keyword>deep convection</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>greenland sea</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic circulation</keyword><keyword>upper ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-12-064.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fenty, I., &amp;amp; Heimbach, P.

The analysis is based on an ocean and sea ice state estimate covering the summer-to-summer 1996/97 annual cycle. The estimate is a synthesis of in situ and satellite hydrographic and ice data with a regional coupled 1/3 degrees ocean-sea ice model. SI advective processes are first demonstrated to be required to reproduce the observed ice extent. With advection, the marginal ice zone (MIZ) location stabilizes where ice melt balances ice mass convergence, a quasi-equilibrium condition achieved via the convergence of warm subtropical-origin subsurface waters into the mixed layer seaward of the MIZ. An analysis of ocean surface buoyancy fluxes reveals a critical role of low-salinity upper ocean (100 m) anomalies for the advancement of SI seaward of the Arctic Water-Irminger Water Thermohaline Front. Anomalous low-salinity waters slow the rate of buoyancy loss-driven mixed layer deepening, shielding an advancing SI pack from the warm subsurface waters, and are conducive to a positive surface meltwater stabilization enhancement (MESEM) feedback driven by SI meltwater release. The low-salinity upper-ocean hydrographic conditions in which the MESEM efficiently operates are termed sea ice-preconditioned waters (SIPW). The SI extent seaward of the Thermohaline Front is shown to closely correspond to the distribution of SIPW. The analysis of two additional state estimates (1992/93, 2003/04) suggests that interannual hydrographic variability provides a first-order explanation for SI maximum extent anomalies in the region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tenzer, Robert</author><author>Dayoub, Nadim</author><author>Abdalla, Ahmed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of a relative offset between vertical datums at the North and South Islands of New Zealand</title><secondary-title>Applied Geomatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Geomatics</full-title></periodical><pages>133-145</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12518-013-0106-8</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tenzer, R., Dayoub, N., &amp;amp; Abdalla, A.

The relation between these two leveling networks and the Word Height System was then defined using GPS-leveling data and the EGM08 global geopotential model. In this study, we investigate the relative offset between these two vertical datum realizations. This is done based on comparison of the geometric geoid/quasigeoid heights (obtained from GPS and newly adjusted leveling data) with the regional gravimetric geoid/quasigeoid solutions. Moreover, oceanographic and geodetic models of mean dynamic topography (MDT) are used to assess the relative offset between these two vertical datum realizations through the analysis of regional spatial variations of mean sea level (MSL). The comparison of GPS-leveling data with regional gravimetric solutions reveals large systematic distortions (exceeding several decimeters across New Zealand) between the geometric and gravimetric geoid/quasigeoid heights attributed mainly to systematic errors within regional gravimetric solutions. The presence of a significant offset between the vertical datum realizations at the North and South Islands is not confirmed. The MSL difference between tide gauges in Wellington and Dunedin of ∼24 cm is estimated based on the analysis of MDT models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoteit, Ibrahim</author><author>Hoar, Tim</author><author>Gopalakrishnan, Ganesh</author><author>Collins, Nancy</author><author>Anderson, Jeffrey</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A MITgcm/DART ensemble analysis and prediction system with application to the Gulf of Mexico</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>1-23</pages><volume>63</volume><keywords><keyword>Data assimilation</keyword><keyword>Ensemble Kalman filter</keyword><keyword>Gulf of Mexico</keyword><keyword>Ocean state estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2013.03.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hoteit, I., T.

The system integrates the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) assimilation package with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ocean general circulation model (MITgcm). The MITgcm/DART system supports the assimilation of a wide range of ocean observations and uses an ensemble approach to solve the nonlinear assimilation problems. The GoM prediction system was implemented with an eddy-resolving 1/10th degree configuration of the MITgcm. Assimilation experiments were performed over a 6-month period between May and October during a strong loop current event in 1999. The model was sequentially constrained with weekly satellite sea surface temperature and altimetry data. Experiments results suggest that the ensemble-based assimilation system shows a high predictive skill in the GoM, with estimated ensemble spread mainly concentrated around the front of the loop current. Further analysis of the system estimates demonstrates that the ensemble assimilation accurately reproduces the observed features without imposing any negative impact on the dynamical balance of the system. Results from sensitivity experiments with respect to the ensemble filter parameters are also presented and discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morlighem, M</author><author>Seroussi, Hélène</author><author>Larour, E</author><author>Rignot, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inversion of basal friction in Antarctica using exact and incomplete adjoints of a higher-order model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface</full-title></periodical><pages>1746-1753</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>0726 Ice sheets</keyword><keyword>0758 Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>0774 Dynamics</keyword><keyword>0798 Modeling</keyword><keyword>3260 Inverse theory</keyword><keyword>basal friction</keyword><keyword>exact adjoint</keyword><keyword>incomplete adjoint</keyword><keyword>inverse method</keyword><keyword>large-scale modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgrf.20125</electronic-resource-num><notes>Morlighem, M., H.

Here we use a complete map of surface velocity of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to infer the basal friction over the entire continent by combining these observations with a three-dimensional, thermomechanical, higher-order ice sheet numerical model from the Ice Sheet System Model open source software. We demonstrate that inverse methods can be readily applied at the continental scale with appropriate selections of cost function and of scheme of regularization, at a spatial resolution as high as 3 km along the coastline. We compare the convergence of two descent algorithms with the exact and incomplete adjoints to show that the incomplete adjoint is an excellent approximation. The results reveal that the driving stress is almost entirely balanced by the basal shear stress over 80% of the ice sheet. The basal friction coefficient, which relates basal friction to basal velocity, is, however, significantly heterogeneous: it is low on fast moving ice and high near topographic divides. Areas with low values extend far out into the interior, along glacier and ice stream tributaries, almost to the flanks of topographic divides, suggesting that basal sliding is widespread beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, Nadya T</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clarifying the link between surface salinity and freshwater fluxes on monthly to interannual time scales</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>3190-3201</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>1620 Climate dynamics</keyword><keyword>1655 Water cycles</keyword><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>freshwater flux</keyword><keyword>surface salinity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgrc.20200</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vinogradova, N.

However, direct observations of F and its components are sparse and available estimates have substantial uncertainties. In this study we investigate if measurements of sea-surface salinity ( S) can provide an alternative indirect method for estimating F. We examine the relationship between S, F and oceanic fluxes from surface advection and mixing processes, on time scales from months to years, using a consistent estimate of the ocean/atmosphere state obtained from model/data synthesis produced by the ECCO (Estimating Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) consortium. ECCO salinity averaged over the mixed layer is used as an estimate of S. Budget analysis shows that variability in S tendencies can be attributed to both F and oceanic fluxes, demonstrating the importance of the ocean's role in evolution of S, for both local and global mean fields. Regression analysis of the 13 year long ECCO fields shows that there are only a few regions (e.g., subtropical gyres) where S can be used as a proxy for F using linear models, and only at monthly to annual time scales. Results are similar over a range of spatial scales from ∼100 to 2000 km. Findings are discussed in the context of the general sensitivities of S to atmospheric and oceanic processes and the potential of satellite salinity measurements to constrain estimates of F.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goldberg, D N</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Parameter and state estimation with a time-dependent adjoint marine ice sheet model</title><secondary-title>The Cryosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Cryosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>1659-1678</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/tc-7-1659-2013</electronic-resource-num><notes>Goldberg, D.

At seasonal and intraseasonal time scales, polar motions are dominated by angular momentum fluctuations due to mass redistributions and relative motions in the atmosphere, oceans, and continental water, snow, and ice. In this study, we compare the geophysical excitations derived from various global atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological models (NCEP, ECCO, ERA40, ERAinterim, and ECMWF operational products), and construct two model sets LDC1 and LDC2 by combining the above models with a least difference method. Comparisons between the geodetic excitation (derived from the polar motion series IERS EOP 08 C04) and the geophysical excitations (based on those meteorological models) imply that the atmospheric models are the most reliable while the hydrological ones are the most inaccurate; that the ERAinterim is, in general, the best model set among the original ones, but the combined models LDC1 and LDC2 are much better than ERAinterim; and that applying the frequency-dependent transfer functions to LDC1 and LDC2 improves their agreements with the geodetic excitation. Thus, we conclude that the combined models LDC1 and LDC2 are reliable, and the frequency-dependent Love numbers and polar motion transfer functions are well modeled.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Schmitt, Raymond W</author><author>Baker, D James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate change as an intergenerational problem</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>4435-4436</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.1302536110</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., R.

Here, we examine the nature and driving forces behind those fluctuations. We find that the nonseasonal variability of the Arctic Ocean mass is strongly coupled to wind forcing. The zonal wind pattern is correlated with a dipole pattern of Arctic Ocean mass changes. Westerly wind intensification over the North Atlantic at about 60°N as well as over the Russian Arctic continental shelf break cause the ocean mass to decrease in the Nordic seas and in the central Arctic, and to increase over the Russian Arctic shelf. Basin-wide Arctic Ocean mass fluctuations are correlated with northward wind anomalies over the northeastern North Atlantic and Nordic seas, and over the Bering Sea. We show that positive (negative) Arctic Ocean mass anomalies are associated with anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomalies of the large-scale ocean circulation pattern. Based on ocean model simulations, we conclude that the observed nonseasonal Arctic Ocean mass variability is mostly explained by the net horizontal wind-driven transports, and the contribution of fresh water fluxes is negligible. We demonstrate that transport anomalies across both the Atlantic and Pacific gateways were equally important for generating large Arctic Ocean mass anomalies in 2011.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Gao, S</author><author>Fine, R A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subduction of South Pacific Tropical Water and Its Equatorward Pathways as Shown by a Simulated Passive Tracer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1551-1565</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>displacements</keyword><keyword>formation rates</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>origin</keyword><keyword>project</keyword><keyword>subtropical underwater</keyword><keyword>warm pool</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-12-0180.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Qu, T.

The results show that approximately 5.8 Sv (1 Sv 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) of the SPTW is formed in the subtropical South Pacific Ocean within the density range between 24.0 and 25.0 kg m(-3), of which about 87% is due to vertical pumping and 13% is due to lateral induction, comparing reasonably well with estimates from climatological data. Once subducted, most SPTW spreads in the subtropical South Pacific. Because of the presence of mixing, some portion of the water is transformed, and its tracer-weighted density steadily increases from an initial value of 24.4 to nearly 25.0 kg m(-3) after 13 years of integration. Approximately 42% of the water makes its way into the equatorial Pacific, either through the western boundary or interior pathway. The two equatorward pathways are essentially of equal importance. A large (similar to 70%) portion of the SPTW entering the equatorial region resurfaces in the central equatorial Pacific. The potential impacts of the resurfacing SPTW on the equatorial thermocline and surface stratification are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khatiwala, S</author><author>Tanhua, T</author><author>Fletcher, S M</author><author>Gerber, M</author><author>Doney, S C</author><author>Graven, H D</author><author>Gruber, N</author><author>McKinley, Galen A.</author><author>Murata, A</author><author>Rios, A F</author><author>Sabine, C L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global ocean storage of anthropogenic carbon</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2169-2191</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>bulk data</keyword><keyword>co2 storage</keyword><keyword>deep-water</keyword><keyword>dissolved inorganic carbon</keyword><keyword>indian-ocean</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword><keyword>subpolar north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>transit-time</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-10-2169-2013</electronic-resource-num><notes>Khatiwala, S., and Coauthors, 2013: Global ocean storage of anthropogenic carbon.

Robust estimates of the magnitude and variability of the storage and distribution of C-ant in the ocean are therefore important for understanding the human impact on climate. In this synthesis we review observational and model-based estimates of the storage and transport of C-ant in the ocean. We pay particular attention to the uncertainties and potential biases inherent in different inference schemes. On a global scale, three data-based estimates of the distribution and inventory of C-ant are now available. While the inventories are found to agree within their uncertainty, there are considerable differences in the spatial distribution. We also present a review of the progress made in the application of inverse and data assimilation techniques which combine ocean interior estimates of C-ant with numerical ocean circulation models. Such methods are especially useful for estimating the air-sea flux and interior transport of C-ant, quantities that are otherwise difficult to observe directly. However, the results are found to be highly dependent on modeled circulation, with the spread due to different ocean models at least as large as that from the different observational methods used to estimate C-ant. Our review also highlights the importance of repeat measurements of hydro-graphic and biogeochemical parameters to estimate the storage of C-ant on decadal timescales in the presence of the variability in circulation that is neglected by other approaches. Data-based C-ant estimates provide important constraints on forward ocean models, which exhibit both broad similarities and regional errors relative to the observational fields. A compilation of inventories of C-ant gives us a &quot;best&quot; estimate of the global ocean inventory of anthropogenic carbon in 2010 of 155 +/- 31 PgC (+/- 20% uncertainty). This estimate includes a broad range of values, suggesting that a combination of approaches is necessary in order to achieve a robust quantification of the ocean sink of anthropogenic CO2.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kalmikov, Alexander G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Uncertainty Quantification in ocean state estimation</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>MIT-WHOI Joint Program</publisher><notes>Kalmikov, A.

After accounting for firn compaction anomalies, the thinning appears to coincide with fast-flowing ice indicating a dynamical origin. Here, to elucidate these observations, we apply high-resolution ice–ocean modelling. Totten Ice Shelf is simulated to have higher, more variable basal melting rates. We link this variability to the volume of cold water, originating in polynyas upon sea ice formation, reaching the sub-ice-shelf cavity. Hence, we propose that the observed increased thinning of Totten Glacier is due to enhanced basal melting caused by a decrease in cold polynya water reaching its cavity. We support this hypothesis with passive microwave data of polynya extent variability. Considering the widespread changes in sea ice conditions, this mechanism could be contributing extensively to ice-shelf instability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roquet, Fabien</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Guinet, Christophe</author><author>Reverdin, Gilles</author><author>Charrassin, Jean-Benoit</author><author>Bailleul, Frederic</author><author>Costa, Daniel P</author><author>Huckstadt, Luis A</author><author>Goetz, Kimberly T</author><author>Kovacs, Kit M</author><author>Lydersen, Christian</author><author>Biuw, Martin</author><author>Nøst, Ole A</author><author>Bornemann, Horst</author><author>Ploetz, Joachim</author><author>Bester, Marthan N</author><author>McIntyre, Trevor</author><author>Muelbert, Monica C</author><author>Hindell, Mark A</author><author>McMahon, Clive R</author><author>Williams, Guy</author><author>Harcourt, Robert</author><author>Field, Iain C</author><author>Chafik, Leon</author><author>Nicholls, Keith W</author><author>Boehme, Lars</author><author>Fedak, Mike A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimates of the Southern Ocean general circulation improved by animal-borne instruments</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>6176-6180</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4283 Water masses</keyword><keyword>4594 Instruments and techniques</keyword><keyword>4858 Population dynamics and ecology</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>animal-borne sampling</keyword><keyword>hydrography</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2013GL058304</electronic-resource-num><notes>Roquet, F., and Coauthors, 2013: Estimates of the Southern Ocean general circulation improved by animal-borne instruments.

A calibrated collection of seal-derived hydrographic data is now available, consisting of more than 165,000 profiles. The value of these hydrographic data within the existing Southern Ocean observing system is demonstrated herein by conducting two state estimation experiments, differing only in the use or not of seal data to constrain the system. Including seal-derived data substantially modifies the estimated surface mixed-layer properties and circulation patterns within and south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Agreement with independent satellite observations of sea ice concentration is improved, especially along the East Antarctic shelf. Instrumented animals efficiently reduce a critical observational gap, and their contribution to monitoring polar climate variability will continue to grow as data accuracy and spatial coverage increase.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abernathey, Ryan</author><author>Ferreira, David</author><author>Klocker, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diagnostics of isopycnal mixing in a circumpolar channel</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><volume>72</volume><keywords><keyword>Antarctic Circumpolar Current</keyword><keyword>Eddy diffusivity</keyword><keyword>Isopycnal mixing</keyword><keyword>Mesoscale eddies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2013.07.004</electronic-resource-num><notes>Abernathey, R., D.

This paper compares different methods of diagnosing eddy mixing rates in an idealized, eddy-resolving model of a channel flow meant to resemble the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The first set of methods, the “perfect” diagnostics, are techniques suitable only to numerical models, in which detailed synoptic data is available. The perfect diagnostic include flux-gradient diffusivities of buoyancy, QGPV, and Ertel PV; Nakamura effective diffusivity; and the four-element diffusivity tensor calculated from an ensemble of passive tracers. These diagnostics reveal a consistent picture of isopycnal mixing by eddies, with a pronounced maximum near 1000 m depth. The isopycnal diffusivity differs from the buoyancy diffusivity, a.k.a. the Gent–McWilliams transfer coefficient, which is weaker and peaks near the surface and bottom. The second set of methods are observationally “practical” diagnostics. They involve monitoring the spreading of tracers or Lagrangian particles in ways that are plausible in the field. We show how, with sufficient ensemble size, the practical diagnostics agree with the perfect diagnostics in an average sense. Some implications for eddy parameterization are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Condron, Alan</author><author>Renfrew, Ian A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of polar mesoscale storms on northeast Atlantic Ocean circulation</title><secondary-title>Nature Geosci</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Geosci</full-title></periodical><pages>34-37</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Nature Publishing Group</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ngeo1661</electronic-resource-num><notes>Condron, A., &amp;amp; Renfrew, I.

The model configuration and water properties are based on data collected in Sermilik Fjord near Helheim Glacier, a major Greenland outlet glacier. The approximately two-layer stratification of the fjord's ambient waters causes the meltwater plume at the glacier front to drive a “double cell” circulation with two distinct outflows, one at the free surface and one at the layers' interface. In summer, the discharge of surface runoff at the base of the glacier (subglacial discharge) causes the circulation to be much more vigorous and associated with a larger melt rate than in winter. The simulated “double cell” circulation is consistent, in both seasons, with observations from Sermilik Fjord. Seasonal differences are also present in the vertical structure of the melt rate, which is maximum at the base of the glacier in summer and at the layers' interface in winter. Simulated submarine melt rates are strongly sensitive to the amount of subglacial discharge, to changes in water temperature, and to the height of the layers. They are also consistent with those inferred from simplified one-dimensional models based on the theory of buoyant plumes. Our results also indicate that to correctly represent the dynamics of the meltwater plume, care must be taken in the choice of viscosity and diffusivity values in the model.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhai, Xiaoming</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Variability of Wind Power Input to the Oceans with a Focus on the Subpolar North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3892-3903</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Ocean circulation,Wind stress,North Atlantic Oscil</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00472.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhai, X., and C.

This trend is interpreted as a spurious result of the changing observational system. Focusing therefore on the North Atlantic Ocean, where the database is somewhat more secure, it is found that the input power in the subpolar North Atlantic varies significantly in time, showing a strong relationship to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). During positive NAO index years, power input is greater owing to enhanced synoptic activity. Furthermore, cumulative power input to the subpolar North Atlantic is found to correlate significantly with both the eddy kinetic energy there and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), although the physical mechanism at work remains unclear. The assumption that the changing ocean can be neglected relative to the changing atmosphere in calculating the power input is found to be a usefully accurate approximation over the two decades for which changing ocean state estimates are available. Strong dependence on synoptic weather systems of monthly-mean stress distributions implies that past and future climate simulations must account properly for changes in weather systems, not just the large-scale variations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Landerer, Felix W</author><author>Kirillov, Sergey A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The genesis of sea level variability in the Barents Sea</title><secondary-title>Continental Shelf Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Continental Shelf Research</full-title></periodical><pages>92-104</pages><volume>66</volume><keywords><keyword>Arctic seas</keyword><keyword>Barents Sea</keyword><keyword>ECCO2</keyword><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>Satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>Sea level variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.csr.2013.07.007</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

The present study explores the nature of sea level variability in the Barents Sea—a marginal shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. A characteristic feature that distinguishes this sea from other Arctic shelf seas is that it is largely ice free throughout the year. This allows continuous monitoring of sea level by space-borne altimeters. In this work we combine satellite altimetry, ocean gravity measurements by GRACE satellites, available hydrography data, and a high-resolution ocean data synthesis product to estimate the steric and mass-related components of sea level in the Barents Sea. We present one of the first observational evidence of the local importance of the mass-related sea level changes. The observed 1–3 month phase lag between the annual cycles of sea level in the Barents Sea and in the Nordic seas (Norwegian, Iceland, Greenland seas) is explained by the annual mass-related changes. The analysis of the barotropic vorticity budget shows that the mass-related sea level variability in the central part of the Barents Sea is determined by the combined effect of wind stress, flow over the varying bottom topography, and dissipation, while the impact of vorticity fluxes is negligible. Overall, the steric sea level has smaller amplitudes and mainly varies on the seasonal time scale. The thermosteric sea level is the main contributor to the steric sea level along the pathways of the Atlantic inflow into the Barents Sea. The relative contribution of the halosteric sea level is dominant in the southeastern, eastern, and northern parts of the Barents Sea, modulated by the seasonal sea ice formation/melt as well as by continental runoff. The variability of the thermosteric sea level in the Barents Sea is mostly driven by variations in the net surface heat flux, whereas the contribution of heat advection becomes as important as the ocean-atmosphere heat exchange at interannual time scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manizza, M</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Hill, C N</author><author>Key, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes in the Arctic Ocean CO 2 sink (1996-2007): A regional model analysis</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>1108-1118</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>0428 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>ocean productivity</keyword><keyword>sea ice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2012GB004491</electronic-resource-num><notes>Manizza, M., Follows, M.

We use a regional physical-biogeochemical model of the Arctic Ocean, forced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research atmospheric reanalysis, to evaluate the mean present-day CO2 sink and its temporal evolution. During the 1996–2007 period, the model suggests that the Arctic average sea surface temperature warmed by 0.04°C a−1, that sea ice area decreased by ∼0.1 × 106 km2 a−1, and that the biological drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon increased. The simulated 1996–2007 time-mean Arctic Ocean CO2 sink is 58 ± 6 Tg C a−1. The increase in ice-free ocean area and consequent carbon drawdown during this period enhances the CO2 sink by ∼1.4 Tg C a−1, consistent with estimates based on extrapolations of sparse data. A regional analysis suggests that during the 1996–2007 period, the shelf regions of the Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas experienced an increase in the efficiency of their biological pump due to decreased sea ice area, especially during the 2004–2007 period, consistent with independently published estimates of primary production. In contrast, the CO2 sink in the Barents Sea is reduced during the 2004–2007 period due to a dominant control by warming and decreasing solubility. Thus, the effect of decreasing sea ice area and increasing sea surface temperature partially cancel, though the former is dominant.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Covariances and linear predictability of the Atlantic Ocean</title><secondary-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>228-243</pages><volume>85</volume><keywords><keyword>Extreme events</keyword><keyword>Meridionaloverturning</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Prediction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dsr2.2012.07.015</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2013: Covariances and linear predictability of the Atlantic Ocean.

To be worthwhile, any nonlinear method would need to exhibit greater skill, and so a rough baseline from which to judge more complex methods is the goal. A 16-year ocean state estimate is used, under the assumption that internal oceanic variability is dominating externally imposed changes. No evidence exists of significant nonlinearity in the bulk of the system over this time span. Linear predictability is the story of time and space correlations, and some predictive skill exists for a few months in SST, with some minor capability extending to a few years. Sixteen years is, however, far too short for an evaluation for interannual, much less decadal, variability, although orders of magnitude are likely stably estimated. The meridional structure of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), defined as the time-varying vertical integral to the maximum meridional volume transport at each latitude, shows nearly complete decorrelation in the variability across about 35°N—the Gulf Stream system. If a time-scale exists displaying coherence of the MOC between subpolar and subtropical gyres, it lies beyond the existing observation duration, and that has consequences for observing system strategies and the more general problem of detectability of change.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reynolds, Richard W</author><author>Chelton, Dudley B</author><author>Roberts-Jones, Jonah</author><author>Martin, Matthew J</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Merchant, Christopher John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Objective Determination of Feature Resolution in Two Sea Surface Temperature Analyses</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>2514-2533</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Numerical analysis/modeling</keyword><keyword>Surface temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00787.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Reynolds, R.

Because grid resolution is not the same as feature resolution, a method is needed to objectively determine the resolution capability and accuracy of SST analysis products. Ocean model SST fields are used in this study as simulated “true” SST data and subsampled based on actual infrared and microwave satellite data coverage. The subsampled data are used to simulate sampling errors due to missing data. Two different SST analyses are considered and run using both the full and the subsampled model SST fields, with and without additional noise. The results are compared as a function of spatial scales of variability using wavenumber auto- and cross-spectral analysis.The spectral variance at high wavenumbers (smallest wavelengths) is shown to be attenuated relative to the true SST because of smoothing that is inherent to both analysis procedures. Comparisons of the two analyses (both having grid sizes of roughly ) show important differences. One analysis tends to reproduce small-scale features more accurately when the high-resolution data coverage is good but produces more spurious small-scale noise when the high-resolution data coverage is poor. Analysis procedures can thus generate small-scale features with and without data, but the small-scale features in an SST analysis may be just noise when high-resolution data are sparse. Users must therefore be skeptical of high-resolution SST products, especially in regions where high-resolution (~5 km) infrared satellite data are limited because of cloud cover.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chaudhuri, A H</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Forget, G</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Comparison of Atmospheric Reanalysis Surface Products over the Ocean and Implications for Uncertainties in Air-Sea Boundary Forcing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>153-170</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>discharge</keyword><keyword>fresh-water</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>global precipitation</keyword><keyword>heat-flux</keyword><keyword>numerical weather prediction</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>sensitivity</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>turbulent fluxes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jcli-d-12-00090.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chaudhuri, A.

Four reanalysis products, namely from 1) the interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), 2) version 2 of the Common Reference Ocean-Ice Experiments (CORE2), 3) the 25-Year Japanese Reanalysis Project (JRA-25), and 4) NCEP-NCAR, are evaluated against satellite-derived observations for eight different fields (zonal and meridional winds, precipitation, specific humidity, continental discharge, surface air temperature, and downwelling longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes). No single product is found to agree better in all fields with satellite-derived observations. Reanalysis products are mostly comparable to each other because of their similar physical assumptions and assimilation of common observations. Adjusted atmospheric fields from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) optimizations are also in agreement with other reanalysis products. Time-mean and time-variable errors are estimated separately and mapped globally in space, based on 14-day average fields to focus on monthly to interannual periods. Time-variable errors are larger in comparison to the signal than time-mean errors for most fields, thus justifying the need to separate them for studying uncertainties as well as formulating optimization procedures. Precipitation and wind stress fields show significant time-mean and time-variable errors whereas downwelling radiation, air temperature, and humidity fields show small time-mean errors but large time-variable errors, particularly in the tropics. Uncertainties based on evaluating multiple products presented here are considerably larger than uncertainties based on single product pairs.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peng, P</author><author>Zhu, Y Z</author><author>Zhong, M</author><author>Yan, H M</author><author>Kang, K X</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Annual sea level fingerprint caused by global water mass transport</title><secondary-title>Chinese Journal of Geophysics-Chinese Edition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Journal of Geophysics-Chinese Edition</full-title></periodical><pages>824-833</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Earth</keyword><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>Ocean bottom pressure</keyword><keyword>Sea level</keyword><keyword>Self-attraction</keyword><keyword>Tide gauges</keyword><keyword>equation</keyword><keyword>gravimetry</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>reevaluation</keyword><keyword>rotating earth</keyword><keyword>rotation effect</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.6038/cjg20130311</electronic-resource-num><notes>Peng, P., Y.

The effects of water exchange among Atmosphere, Hydrology and Ocean (AHO) are always seen as a uniform thin layer. But in fact, it has been demonstrated that the mass exchange among AHO will result in a highly nonuniform patterns of sea level change due to the crust deformation and self-attraction loading (SAL) effect called sea-level fingerprints. Generally, ocean model obeys the Boussinesq hypothesis that volume conserves while ignoring the SAL effect. Here we analyze the SAL effect of AHO during 2003 and 2010 through solving the sea level function. The main results are: (1) while considering SAL effect, the spatial patterns in the annual terms of sea level changes vary significantly especially near coastal areas and at low-latitude regions. The maximum amplitude can reach 1. 3 similar to 19 mm. (2) At annual time-scale, the impact of hydrology is maximal, and less is atmosphere and ocean, while SAL effect caused by ocean has the most complex phase spatial distribution. (3) When SAL effect is included in ocean ECCO OBP model, it can explain more 5. 3% variance reduction from a global set of tide gauges.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Speer, K</author><author>Forget, G</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Siedler, G</author><author>Griffies, S M</author><author>Gould, J</author><author>Church, J A</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Global distribution and formation of mode waters</title><secondary-title>Ocean Circulation and Climate: a 21st Century Perspective</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Circulation and Climate: a 21st Century Perspective</full-title></periodical><pages>211-226</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Academic Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/B978-0-12-391851- 2.00009-X</electronic-resource-num><notes>Speer, K., and G.

Increased submarine melting is thought to have triggered the retreat of Greenland's outlet glaciers, which is partly responsible for the ice loss. However, the chain of events and physical processes remain elusive. Recent evidence suggests that an anomalous inflow of subtropical waters driven by atmospheric changes, multidecadal natural ocean variability and a long-term increase in the North Atlantic's upper ocean heat content since the 1950s all contributed to a warming of the subpolar North Atlantic. This led, in conjunction with increased runoff, to enhanced submarine glacier melting. Future climate projections raise the potential for continued increases in warming and ice-mass loss, with implications for sea level and climate.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coupled Sea Ice-Ocean-State Estimation in the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>884-904</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>cover</keyword><keyword>deep convection</keyword><keyword>eddies</keyword><keyword>fresh-water</keyword><keyword>greenland</keyword><keyword>heat fluxes</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic sst</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>western boundary currents</keyword><keyword>winter circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-12-065.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fenty, I., &amp;amp; Heimbach, P.

Historically, quantifying the relationship between sea ice and ocean variability has been difficult because of in situ observation paucity and technical challenges associated with synthesizing observations with numerical models. Here the relationship between ice and ocean variability is explored by analyzing new estimates of the ocean-ice state in the northwest North Atlantic. The estimates are syntheses of in situ and satellite hydrographic and ice data with a regional 1/3 degrees coupled ocean-sea ice model. The synthesis of sea ice data is achieved with an improved adjoint of a thermodynamic ice model. Model and data are made consistent, in a least squares sense, by iteratively adjusting control variables, including ocean initial and lateral boundary conditions and the atmospheric state, to minimize an uncertainty-weighted model-data misfit cost function. The utility of the state estimate is demonstrated in an analysis of energy and buoyancy budgets in the marginal ice zone (MIZ). In mid-March the system achieves a state of quasi-equilibrium during which net ice growth and melt approaches zero; newly formed ice diverges from coastal areas and converges via wind and ocean forcing in the MIZ. The convergence of ice mass in the MIZ is ablated primarily by turbulent ocean-ice enthalpy fluxes. The primary source of the enthalpy required for sustained MIZ ice ablation is the sensible heat reservoir of the subtropical-origin subsurface waters.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Y</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Fenty, Ian</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Flexas, M M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Subaqueous melting of Store Glacier, west Greenland from three-dimensional, high-resolution numerical modeling and ocean observations</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>4648-4653</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>Greenland</keyword><keyword>acceleration</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>east greenland</keyword><keyword>fjord</keyword><keyword>glaciology</keyword><keyword>hydrology</keyword><keyword>ice-sheet</keyword><keyword>ocean modeling</keyword><keyword>parameterization</keyword><keyword>tidewater glaciers</keyword><keyword>waters</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/grl.50825</electronic-resource-num><notes>Xu, Y., E.

We compare the simulated ice melt with an estimate derived from oceanographic data. The simulations show turbulent upwelling and spreading of the freshwater-laden plume along the ice face and the vigorous melting of ice at rates of meters per day. The simulated August 2010 melt rate of 2.00.3m/d is within uncertainties of the melt rate of 3.01.0m/d calculated from oceanographic data. Melting is greatest at depth, above the subglacial channels, causing glacier undercutting. Melt rates increase proportionally to thermal forcing raised to the power of 1.2-1.6 and to subglacial water flux raised to the power of 0.5-0.9. Therefore, in a warmer climate, Store Glacier melting by ocean may increase from both increased ocean temperature and subglacial discharge.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baringer, M O</author><author>Johns, W E</author><author>McCarthy, G D</author><author>Willis, J</author><author>Garzoli, S</author><author>Lankhorst, M</author><author>Meinen, C S</author><author>Send, U</author><author>Hobbs, W R</author><author>Cunningham, S A</author><author>Rayner, D</author><author>Smeed, D A</author><author>Kanzow, T</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Frajka-Williams, E</author><author>Macdonald, A</author><author>Dong, S</author><author>Marotzke, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meridional overturning circulation and heat transport observations in the Atlantic Ocean</title><secondary-title>State of the Climate in 2012</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>State of the Climate in 2012</full-title></periodical><pages>S65--S68</pages><volume>94</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><notes>Baringer, M.

The Estimating Circulation and Climate of Ocean (ECCO) ocean state estimate is used to initialize the ocean component of the coupled model, and the source of deficiencies in the simulation of Katrina intensity is investigated in relation to the initial depth of 26 A degrees C isotherm (D26). The model underestimates the intensity of Katrina partly due to shallow D26 in ECCO. Sensitivity tests with various ECCO initial fields indicate that the correct relationship between intensity and D26 cannot be derived because D26 variability is underestimated in ECCO. A series of idealized experiments is carried out by modifying initial ECCO D26 to match the observed range. A more reasonable relationship between Katrina's intensity and pre-storm D26 emerges: the intensity is much more sensitive to D26 than to sea surface temperature (SST). Ocean mixed layer process plays a critical role in modulating inner-core SSTs when D26 is deep, reducing mixed layer cooling and lowering the center pressure of the Katrina. Our result lends strong support to the notion that accurate initialization of pre-storm subsurface thermal structure in prediction models is critical for a skillful forecast of intensity of Katrina and likely other intense storms.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Buoyancy-Driven Interannual Sea Level Changes in the Tropical South Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>533-547</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>South Atlantic Ocean,Buoyancy,Rossby waves,Barocli</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-12-093.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

While skillful in some regions, these processes alone cannot explain low levels of interannual sea level variability observed in the tropical Atlantic. In this study, through a set of modeling approaches, interannual sea level changes in the tropical South Atlantic are attributed and the dynamical influence of buoyancy forcing is elucidated. Similar to recent findings in the southeast tropical Pacific, sea level patterns in the tropical South Atlantic (as estimated from a data-constrained ocean general circulation model) are found to result from the action of both surface wind and buoyancy forcing; in addition to static local effects, the buoyancy-driven changes comprise important nonlocal ocean dynamical processes. It is shown that the buoyancy-driven sea level changes can be understood within the framework of a linear first baroclinic mode Rossby wave model forced by atmospheric fields and variability along the eastern boundary. To lowest order, the linear model framework also reproduces qualitative patterns of basinwide compensation between wind- and buoyancy-driven sea level changes, which are mostly tied to the anticorrelation of both surface and boundary forcing. Results suggest that the ocean’s dynamical adjustment to buoyancy forcing exerts an important influence on interannual sea level changes across all tropical oceans.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morlighem, M</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Mouginot, J</author><author>Wu, X</author><author>Seroussi, Hélène</author><author>Larour, E</author><author>Paden, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-resolution bed topography mapping of Russell Glacier, Greenland, inferred from Operation IceBridge data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>1015-1023</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>218</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/2013JoG12J235</electronic-resource-num><notes>Morlighem, M., E.

Such maps are traditionally obtained using airborne radarsounding profiler data interpolated onto regular grids using geostatistical tools such as kriging. Here we compare three mapping techniques applied to a dense radar survey of Russell Glacier, West Greenland, by NASA Operation IceBridge: (1) radar tomography (RT) processing of the radar data to map the bed elevation, (2) interpolation of radar-derived thickness by ordinary kriging (KR) and (3) reconstruction of ice thickness based on the principles of mass conservation (MC) combining radar-sounding profiler and ice motion data. RT eliminates ambiguities caused by off-nadir reflections, but is spatially limited. KR yields a standard error in bed elevation of 35 m, but large errors (&gt;300m a-1) in flux divergence when combined with ice motion data. MC yields a comparable performance in bed elevation mapping, and errors smaller than 1m a-1 in flux divergence. When the number of radar-sounding tracks is reduced, the performance of KR decreases more rapidly than for MC. Our study site shows that MC is capable of maintaining precision levels of 60m at 400m posting with flight tracks separated by 5 km. © 2014 Publishing Technology.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clayton, Sophie</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Jahn, Oliver</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dispersal, eddies, and the diversity of marine phytoplankton</title><secondary-title>Limnology and Oceanography: Fluids and Environments</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Limnology and Oceanography: Fluids and Environments</full-title></periodical><pages>182-197</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>biodiversity</keyword><keyword>hotspots</keyword><keyword>plankton</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1215/21573689-2373515</electronic-resource-num><notes>Clayton, S., Dutkiewicz, S., Jahn, O., &amp;amp; Follows, M.

Swifter current speeds, faster dispersal, and increased environmental variability in the higher-resolution model enhanced local diversity almost everywhere. In the numerical simulations, each resolved phytoplankton type was characterized as “locally adapted” at any geographical location (i.e., having net local biological production and physical export) or “immigrant” (i.e., net local biological loss but a population sustained by immigration via physical transport). Immigrants accounted for a higher fraction of the total diversity in the equatorial and subtropical regions, where the exclusion timescale is long relative to the physical transport between “provinces.” Hotspots of diversity were associated with western boundary currents and coastal upwelling regions. The former had high locally adapted diversity within the core of the current system, maintained by confluence of upstream populations and the induction of nutrient resources, as well as environmental variability associated with mesoscale eddies. Downstream of strong nutrient sources, convergence of populations led to immigrant-dominated diversity. The numerical simulations provide testable predictions of patterns in diversity and hypotheses regarding the mechanisms that control them. Molecular approaches to characterizing diversity in microbial populations will provide a means to test these hypotheses.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Ferrari, Raffaele</author><author>Schneider, Tapio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Force Balance of the Southern Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1193-1208</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Southern Ocean,Forcing,Meridional overturning circ</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-12-069.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mazloff, M.

The buoyancy transport in the SO is dominated by the upper and middle MOC cells, with the middle cell accounting for most of the buoyancy transport across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. A Southern Ocean state estimate for the years 2005 and 2006 with ⅙° resolution is used to determine the forces balancing this MOC. Diagnosing the zonal momentum budget in density space allows an exact determination of the adiabatic and diapycnal components balancing the thickness-weighted (residual) meridional transport. It is found that, to lowest order, the transport consists of an eddy component, a directly wind-driven component, and a component in balance with mean pressure gradients. Nonvanishing time-mean pressure gradients arise because isopycnal layers intersect topography or the surface in a circumpolar integral, leading to a largely geostrophic MOC even in the latitude band of Drake Passage. It is the geostrophic water mass transport in the surface layer where isopycnals outcrop that accomplishes the poleward buoyancy transport.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Aurelien L.</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coastal numerical modelling of tides: Sensitivity to domain size and remotely generated internal tide</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>17-26</pages><volume>62</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2012.11.007</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, A.

Oceanic observations collected during the VOCALS-REx cruise time period, 1–30 November 2008, are assimilated into a regional ocean model (ROMS) using 4DVAR and then analyzed for their dynamics. Nonlinearities in the system prevent a complete 30-day fit, so two 15-day fits for 1–15 November and 16–30 November are executed using the available observations of hydrographic temperature and salinity, along with satellite fields of SST and sea-level height anomaly. The fits converge and reduce the cost function significantly, and the results indicated that ROMS is able to successfully reproduce both large-scale and smaller-scale features of the flows observed during the VOCALS-REx cruise. Particular attention is focused on an intensively studied eddy at 76° W, 19° S. The ROMS fits capture this eddy as an isolated rotating 3-D vortex with a strong subsurface signature in velocity, temperature and anomalously low salinity. The eddy has an average temperature anomaly of approximately −0.5 °C over a depth range from 50–600 m and features a cold anomaly of approximately −1 °C near 150 m depth. The eddy moves northwestward and elongates during the second 15-day fit. It exhibits a strong signature in the Okubo-Weiss parameter, which indicates significant nonlinearity in its evolution. The heat balance for the period of the cruise from the ocean state estimate reveals that the horizontal advection and the vertical mixing processes are the dominant terms that balance the temperature tendency of the upper layer of the ocean locally in time and space. Areal averages around the eddies, for a 15-day period during the cruise, suggest that vertical mixing processes generally balance the surface heating. Although, this indicates only a small role for lateral advective processes in this region during this period, this quasi-instantaneous heat budget analysis cannot be extended to interpret the seasonal or long-term upper ocean heat budget in this region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Song, Hajoon</author><author>Hoteit, Ibrahim</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce D.</author><author>Luo, Xiaodong</author><author>Subramanian, Aneesh C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Adjoint-Based Adaptive Ensemble Kalman Filter</title><secondary-title>Monthly Weather Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Monthly Weather Review</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0027-0644</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/MWR-D-12-00244.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Song, H., Hoteit, I., Cornuelle, B.

The work is based on the adaptive EnKF (AEnKF) method, which bears a strong resemblance to the hybrid EnKF/three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3D-VAR) method. In the AEnKF, the representativeness of the EnKF ensemble is regularly enhanced with new members generated after back projection of the EnKF analysis residuals to state space using a 3D-VAR [or optimal interpolation (OI)] scheme with a preselected background covariance matrix. The idea here is to reformulate the transformation of the residuals as a 4D-VAR problem, constraining the new member with model dynamics and the previous observations. This should provide more information for the estimation of the new member and reduce dependence of the AEnKF on the assumed stationary background covariance matrix. This is done by integrating the analysis residuals backward in time with the adjoint model. Numerical experiments are performed with the Lorenz-96 model under different scenarios to test the new approach and to evaluate its performance with respect to the EnKF and the hybrid EnKF/3D-VAR. The new method leads to the least root-mean-square estimation errors as long as the linear assumption guaranteeing the stability of the adjoint model holds. It is also found to be less sensitive to choices of the assimilation system inputs and parameters.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gopalakrishnan, Ganesh</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce D.</author><author>Hoteit, Ibrahim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adjoint sensitivity studies of loop current and eddy shedding in the Gulf of Mexico</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>3315-3335</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgrc.20240</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gopalakrishnan, G., Cornuelle, B.

The estimate has been tested by forecasting loop current (LC) evolution and eddy shedding in the GoM. The adjoint (or four-dimensional variational) method was used to match the model evolution to observations by adjusting model temperature and salinity initial conditions, open boundary conditions, and atmospheric forcing fields. The model was fit to satellite-derived along-track sea surface height, separated into temporal mean and anomalies, and gridded sea surface temperature for 2 month periods. The optimized state at the end of the assimilation period was used to initialize the forecast for 2 months. Forecasts explore practical LC predictability and provide a cross-validation test of the state estimate by comparing it to independent future observations. The model forecast was tested for several LC eddy separation events, including Eddy Franklin in May 2010 during the deepwater horizon oil spill disaster in the GoM. The forecast used monthly climatological open boundary conditions, atmospheric forcing, and run-off fluxes. The model performance was evaluated by computing model-observation root-mean-square difference (rmsd) during both the hindcast and forecast periods. The rmsd metrics for the forecast generally outperformed persistence (keeping the initial state fixed) and reference (forecast initialized using assimilated Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model 1/12 degrees global analysis) model simulations during LC eddy separation events for a period of 1 similar to 2 months.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gopalakrishnan, Ganesh</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce</author><author>Gawarkiewicz, Glen</author><author>McClean, Julie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure and Evolution of the Cold Dome off Northeastern Taiwan: A Numerical Study</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2013.06</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gopalakrishnan, G., Cornuelle, B., Gawarkiewicz, G., &amp;amp; McClean, J.

We use a high-resolution (1/24°) ocean model based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model to study the evolution of this distinct shelf-slope circulation phenomenon. We performed a number of model simulations spanning a five-year period (2004–2008) using realistic atmospheric forcing and initial and open boundary conditions. The model solutions were compared with satellite measurements of sea surface height (SSH), sea surface temperature (SST), and historical temperature and salinity observations. The model showed a realistically shaped cold dome with a diameter of ~ 100 km and temperature of ~ 3°C below the ambient shelf waters at 50 m depth. The occurrences of simulated cold dome events appeared to be connected with the seasonal variability of the Kuroshio Current. The model simulations showed more upwelling events during spring and summer when the core of the Kuroshio tends to migrate away from the east coast of Taiwan, compared to fall and winter when the core of the Kuroshio is generally found closer to the east coast of Taiwan. The model also reproduced weak cyclonic circulation associated with the upwelling off northeastern Taiwan. We analyzed the spatio-temporal variability of the cold dome using the model solution as a proxy and designed a &quot;cold dome index&quot; based on the temperature at 50 m depth averaged over a 0.5° × 0.5° box centered at 25.5°N, 122°E. The cold dome index correlates with temperature at 50 m depth in a larger region, suggesting the spatial extent of the cold dome phenomenon. The index had correlation maxima of 0.78 and 0.40 for simulated SSH and SST, respectively, in and around the cold dome box region, and we hypothesize that it is a useful indicator of upwelling off northeastern Taiwan. In addition, both correlation and composite analysis between the temperature at 50 m depth and the East Taiwan Channel transport showed no cold dome events during low-transport events (often in winter) and more frequent cold dome events during high-transport events (often in summer). The simulated cold dome events had time scales of about two weeks, and their centers aligned roughly along a northeastward line starting from the northeastern tip of Taiwan.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>LI, Qun</author><author>ZHANG, Zhanhai</author><author>SUN, Li</author><author>WU, Huiding</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ice concentration assimilation in a regional ice-ocean coupled model and its application in sea ice forecasting</title><secondary-title>Advances in Polar Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Polar Science</full-title></periodical><pages>258</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3724/SP.J.1085.2013.00258</electronic-resource-num><notes>LI, Q., ZHANG, Z., SUN, L., &amp;amp; WU, H.

A number of recent estimates of the global oceanic freshwater balance as well as the global oceanic surface net heat flux are used to investigate the effects of heat- and freshwater forcing at the ocean surface. Such forcing induces changes in both density and density-compensated temperature and salinity changes (’spice’). The ratio of the relative contributions of haline and thermal forcing in the mixed layer is maintained by large-scale surface fluxes, leading to important consequences for mixing in the ocean interior. In a stratified ocean, mixing processes can be either along lines of constant density (isopycnal) or across those lines (diapycnal). The contribution of these processes to the total mixing rate in the ocean can be estimated from the large-scale forcing by evaluating the production of thermal variance, salinity variance and temperature-salinity covariance. Here, I use new estimates of surface fluxes to evaluate these terms and combine them to generate estimates of the production of density and spice variance under the assumption of a linear equation of state. As a consequence, it is possible to estimate the relative importance of isopycnal and diapycnal mixing in the ocean. While isopycnal and diapycnal processes occur on very different length scales, I find that the surface-driven production of density and spice variance requires an approximate equipartition between isopycnal and diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior. In addition, consideration of the full nonlinear equation of state reveals that surface fluxes require an apparent buoyancy gain (expansion) of the ocean, which allows an estimate of the amount of contraction on mixing due to cabbeling in the ocean interior.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cougnon, Eva Audrey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling the sensitivity of dense shelf water formation in the Mertz Glacier region, East Antarctica</title></titles><periodical/><pages>177</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><notes>Cougnon, E.

The offshore properties of AABW are changing. Within the Australian-Antarctic basin AABW has freshened and decreased in volume by about 50% over the last few decades. Understanding what is driving these changes requires focusing on the key formation region along the Adélie and George V Land (AGVL) coast. Here, the intense production of sea ice in the Mertz Glacier Polynya system drives Dense Shelf Water (DSW) formation, the precursor to AABW. This thesis uses a version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) that has been adapted for ocean/ice-shelf interactions to explore the sensitivity of DSW formation to surface heat and salt fluxes and ice shelf basal melting. Interannual variability in surface heat and salt fluxes drives DSW export and ice shelf basal melting variability in the AGVL region. DSW export decreases by 86% during a sustained period (2000-2002) of weak polynya activity (sea ice production) before recovering during a sustained period of stronger polynya activity (2003-2005). Basal melting of the Mertz Glacier Tongue (MGT) doubles under weak polynya activity because more warm water reaches the base of the ice shelf. Idealised simulations highlight the importance of the air/sea fluxes on DSW formation and ice shelf basal melting. A mean to strong air/sea forcing drives convection of dense water to sink at the sea floor and drives melt near the deep grounding line. Weaker air/sea forcing limits the depth of the convection and allows greater intrusions of warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water within the ice shelf cavity and increases basal melting. The resultant input of glacial meltwater produces a buoyant plume that stratifies the water column. Two simulations are run to investigate the impact of the calving of the MGT in 2010. Weaker polynya activity after calving results in an 89% increase in area averaged ice shelf basal melting and an 80% decrease of DSW export from the Adélie depression. Most importantly a distinct warming of the exported DSW leads to a decrease in AABW production downstream. This thesis demonstrates the sensitivity of Antarctic ocean-cryosphere interactions to interannual variability and episodic changes to the local icescape (ice shelves, icebergs and sea ice), finding that ice shelf basal melting and DSW formation in the AGVL region is dramatically impacted by the MGT calving.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weigelt, Patrick</author><author>Kreft, Holger</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying island isolation - insights from global patterns of insular plant species richness</title><secondary-title>Ecography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecography</full-title></periodical><pages>417-429</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07669.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Weigelt, P., &amp;amp; Kreft, H.

The Atlantic Ocean is one of the most important sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), but this sink has been shown to vary substantially in time. Here we use surface ocean CO2 observations to estimate this sink and the temporal variability from 1998 through 2007 in the Atlantic Ocean. We benefit from (i) a continuous improvement of the observations, i.e. the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) v1.5 database and (ii) a newly developed technique to interpolate the observations in space and time. In particular, we use a two-step neural network approach to reconstruct basin-wide monthly maps of the sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) at a resolution of 1° &amp;times; 1°. From those, we compute the air–sea CO2 flux maps using a standard gas exchange parameterization and high-resolution wind speeds. The neural networks fit the observed pCO2 data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of about 10 μatm and with almost no bias. A check against independent time-series data and new data from SOCAT v2 reveals a larger RMSE of 22.8 μatm for the entire Atlantic Ocean, which decreases to 16.3 μatm for data south of 40° N. We estimate a decadal mean uptake flux of −0.45 ± 0.15 Pg C yr−1 for the Atlantic between 44° S and 79° N, representing the sum of a strong uptake north of 18° N (−0.39 ± 0.10 Pg C yr−1), outgassing in the tropics (18° S–18° N, 0.11 ± 0.07 Pg C yr−1), and uptake in the subtropical/temperate South Atlantic south of 18° S (−0.16 ± 0.06 Pg C yr−1), consistent with recent studies. The strongest seasonal variability of the CO2 flux occurs in the temperature-driven subtropical North Atlantic, with uptake in winter and outgassing in summer. The seasonal cycle is antiphased in the subpolar latitudes relative to the subtropics largely as a result of the biologically driven winter-to-summer drawdown of CO2. Over the 10 yr analysis period (1998 through 2007), sea surface pCO2 increased faster than that of the atmosphere in large areas poleward of 40° N, while in other regions of the North Atlantic the sea surface pCO2 increased at a slower rate, resulting in a barely changing Atlantic carbon sink north of the Equator (−0.01 ± 0.02 Pg C yr−1 decade−1). Surface ocean pCO2 increased at a slower rate relative to atmospheric CO2 over most of the Atlantic south of the Equator, leading to a substantial trend toward a stronger CO2 sink for the entire South Atlantic (−0.14 ± 0.02 Pg C yr−1 decade−1). In contrast to the 10 yr trends, the Atlantic Ocean carbon sink varies relatively little on inter-annual timescales (±0.04 Pg C yr−1; 1 &amp;sigma;).</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Msadek, Rym</author><author>Johns, William E.</author><author>Yeager, Stephen G.</author><author>Danabasoglu, Gokhan</author><author>Delworth, Thomas L.</author><author>Rosati, Anthony</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Atlantic Meridional Heat Transport at 26.5°N and Its Relationship with the MOC in the RAPID Array and the GFDL and NCAR Coupled Models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>4335-4356</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00081.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Msadek, R., Johns, W.

Around the perimeter of Antarctica, much of the ice sheet discharges to the ocean through floating ice shelves. The buttressing provided by ice shelves is critical for modulating the flux of ice into the ocean, and the presently observed thinning of ice shelves is believed to be reducing their buttressing capacity and contributing to the acceleration and thinning of the grounded ice sheet. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the role that fractures play in the ability of ice shelves to sustain and transmit buttressing stresses. Here, we present a new framework for quantifying the role that fractures play in the creep deformation and buttressing capacity of ice shelves. We apply principles of continuum damage mechanics to derive a new analytical relation for the creep of an ice shelf that accounts for the softening influence of fractures on longitudinal deformation using a state damage variable. We use this new analytical relation, combined with a temperature calculation for the ice, to partition an inverse method solution for ice shelf rigidity into independent solutions for softening damage and stabilizing backstress. Using this new approach, field and remote sensing data can be utilized to monitor the structural integrity of ice shelves, their ability to buttress the flow of ice at the grounding line, and thus their indirect contribution to ice sheet mass balance and global sea level. We apply this technique to the Larsen C ice shelf using remote sensing and Operation IceBridge data, finding damage in areas with known crevasses and rifts. Backstress is highest near the grounding line and upstream of ice rises, in agreement with patterns observed on other ice shelves. The ice in contact with the Bawden ice rise is weakened by fractures, and additional damage or thinning in this area could diminish the backstress transmitted upstream. We model the consequences for the ice shelf if it loses contact with this small ice rise, finding that flow speeds would increase by 25% or more over an area the size of the former Larsen B ice shelf. Such a perturbation could potentially destabilize the northern part of Larsen C along pre-existing lines of weakness, highlighting the importance of the feedback between buttressing and fracturing in an ice shelf.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blunden, Jessica</author><author>Arndt, Derek S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State of the Climate in 2012</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>S1-S258</pages><volume>94</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2013BAMSStateoftheClimate.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Blunden, J., &amp;amp; Arndt, D.

In this thesis I explore both of these aspects of the interaction between phytoplankton ecology and ocean physics, and have approached this topic in two distinct but complementary ways, working with a global ocean ecosystem model, and collecting data at sea. In the first half of the thesis, I examine the role of mesoscale physical features in shaping phytoplankton community structure and influencing rates of primary production. I compare the output of a complex marine ecosystem model coupled to coarse resolution and eddy-permitting physical models. Explicitly resolving eddies resulted in marked regional variations in primary production, zooplankton and phytoplankton biomass. The same phytoplankton phenotypes persisted in both cases, and were dominant in the same regions. Global phytoplankton diversity was unchanged. However, levels of local phytoplankton diversity were markedly different, with a large increase in local diversity in the higher resolution model. Increased diversity could be attributed to a combination of enhanced dispersal, environmental variability and nutrient supply in the higher resolution model. Diversity &quot;hotspots&quot; associated with western boundary currents and coastal upwelling zones are sustained through a combination of all of these factors. In the second half of the thesis I describe the results of a fine scale ecological and biogeochemical survey of the Kuroshio Extension Front. I found fine scale patterns in physical, chemical and biological properties that can be linked back to both the large scale horizontal and smaller scale vertical physical dynamics of the study region. A targeted genomic analysis of samples focused on the ecology of the picoeukaryote Ostreococcus clade distributions strongly supports the model derived hypotheses about the mechanisms supporting diversity hotspots. Strikingly, two distinct clades of Ostreococcus co-occur in more than half of the samples. A &quot;hotspot&quot; of Ostreococcus diversity appears to be supported by a confluence of water masses containing either clade, as well as a local nutrient supply at the front and the mesoscale variability of the region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schanze, Julian J.</author><author>Schmitt, Raymond W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimates of Cabbeling in the Global Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>698-705</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-12-0119.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schanze, J.

The results show that the HE first appears around May, peaks in July, and dies out in March and April of the following year, which are mainly resulted from the New Guinea Coastal Current (NGCC) seasonality driven by monsoon. The NGCC flows northwestward from April to November, while southeastward from December to next year February. The HE begins to form and intensify with the strengthening of the northwestward NGCC, but decay and disappear with the weakening and re- versing of the northwestward NGCC. In summer, the Mindanao Current strengthens and enhances the HE.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamically and Kinematically Consistent Global Ocean Circulation and Ice State Estimates</title></titles><periodical/><pages>553-579</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/B978-0-12-391851-2.00021-0</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., &amp;amp; Heimbach, P.

University of California, Irvine.</research-notes><urls/><label>ECCO2;IceSheet</label><abstract>The Greenland Ice Sheet has been experiencing accelerating mass loss in the past decades, due to enhanced surface melting and accelerated ice discharge into the ocean through tidewater glaciers. Many tidewater glaciers accelerated as anomalous warm water intruded the glacial fjords. Subaqueous melting of the glaciers in the ocean is a potential trigger of glacier acceleration. However, processes of subaqueous melting are not well understood. In this dissertation, we modify an ocean general circulation model, MITgcm, to include the melting/freezing processes on the vertical calving face of tidewater glaciers. We simulate the subaqueous melting using 2D and 3D con gurations of the numerical model at high resolution (20-m to 1-m grid spacing). The model well represents the turbulent buoyant plume we simulate in a laboratory tank, and is then applied to a glacial fjord domain con gured from oceanographic data we collected in several Greenland tidewater glacier fjords in August 2010 and 2012. The rate and distribution of subglacial freshwater discharge is estimated and to force model simulations. The numerical simulations show the turbulent upwelling and expansion of subglacial freshwater plumes, which induce high rates of subaqueous melting along their routes. Average rates of subaqueous melting of Greenland tidewater glaciers could be several meters per day in summer and an order of magnitude smaller in winter. The melt rate increases less than linearly with subglacial freshwater discharge and more than linearly with the ocean thermal forcing. The uncertainty of the distribution of subglacial freshwater discharge leads to 15% error on the melt rate. We derive a sensitivity relationship between the melt rate and ocean thermal forcing and subglacial water discharge for Store Glacier, and calculate the daily melt rate of Store Glacier between 2008 and 2011. The simulated melt rate in August 2010 compares well with the melt rate derived from the oceanographic data. This study provides simple guidelines for interpreting recent changes in glacier fronts as a result of climate warming and the inclusion of ice-ocean interactions along the calving fronts of Greenland glaciers in ice sheet numerical models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huard, David</author><author>Tremblay, Bruno</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>WWF Last Ice Area</title></titles><periodical/><pages>36</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>Montreal, Canada</pub-location><notes>Huard, D., &amp;amp; Tremblay, B.

Part A of the project looks at results from an ensemble of global climate model projec- tions. The objective of Part A is to explore the various pathways of future ice loss as simulated by different climate models driven by two radiative forcing scenarios. The im- pact of climate change on Arctic conditions is diagnosed through sea ice concentration, sea ice thickness and snow depth over ice. Part B completes the picture by running a high-resolution (18km) regional ocean and ice model, providing finer spatial details of ice conditions projected by the GFDL Climate Model version 3 under the business-as-usual RCP8.5 forcing scenario.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schiller, Andreas</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Masuda, Shuhei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Methods and Applications of Ocean Synthesis in Climate Research</title><secondary-title>Ocean Circulation and Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Circulation and Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>581-608</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/B978-0-12-391851-2.00022-2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schiller, A., Lee, T., &amp;amp; Masuda, S.

Therefore, the study of the Arctic Ocean is very important, and studies on the Arctic sea ice fluctuation based on the model are being actively carried out abroad. However, in Korea, there is no research on the Arctic Ocean. Therefore, in this paper, we tried to understand the present level of the model by simulating ocean Arctic sea ice distribution and comparing it with observation and AOMIP model results. Sea-Ice Hindcast model calculations were carried out for 33 years from 1979 to 2011 using ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System), which is a 3D ocean-sea joining model. The model area is 55 ° N-90 ° N latitude, 180 ° W-180 ° E, excluding the Baltic Sea and the Okhotsk Sea. The sea ice concentration and area are more consistent with the AOMIP model in winter than in the AOMIP model, but are calculated in summer and less volatilized in the East Siberian Sea and the Rapphev Sea. For the thickness of the sea ice, the distribution pattern was reproduced similar to the observations and AOMIP model results, but the thick sea ice near the Canadian islands was not reproduced well. It is considered that the sea ice was not accumulated in the vicinity of the Canadian islands because the sea ice velocity was simulated more than the observation. In addition, the oceanic heat of the Pacific and Atlantic waters did not flow well into the Arctic Ocean and rapidly disappeared, affecting the sea ice in the East Siberian Sea, the Raphaet Sea, and the Chichic Sea. . Therefore, if we reproduce thick sea ice near the Canadian islands by improving the sea ice velocity and improve the flux of the Pacific and Atlantic waters flowing from the Barring and Phram Strait to better reproduce the water mass distributions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, Shuanggen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Satellite Gravimetry: Mass Transport and Redistribution in the Earth System</title><secondary-title>Geodetic Sciences - Observations, Modeling and Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geodetic Sciences - Observations, Modeling and Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>157-174</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>InTech</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5772/51698</electronic-resource-num><notes>Jin, S.

One of these representations is a Morse Connection Graph (MCG), a directed graph whose nodes correspond to Morse sets, generalizing stationary points and periodic trajectories, and arcs - to trajectories connecting them. While being useful for simple vector fields, the MCG can be hard to comprehend for topologically rich vector fields, containing a large number of features. This paper describes a visual representation of the MCG, inspired by previous work on graph visualization. Our approach aims to preserve the spatial relationships between the MCG arcs and nodes and highlight the coherent behavior of connecting trajectories. Using simulations of ocean flow, we show that it can provide useful information on the flow structure. This paper focuses specifically on MCGs computed for piecewise constant (PC) vector fields. In particular, we describe extensions of the PC framework that make it more flexible and better suited for analysis of data on complex shaped domains with a boundary. We also describe a topology simplification scheme that makes our MCG visualizations less ambiguous. Despite the focus on the PC framework, our approach could also be applied to graph representations or topological skeletons computed using different methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nie, Xunwei</author><author>Gao, Shan</author><author>Wang, Fan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heat budget in the subduction region of the North Pacific central mode water as revealed by a global general circulation model</title><secondary-title>Marine Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><notes>Nie, X., Gao, S., &amp;amp; Wang, F.

The relationship between the heat budget and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was analyzed emphatically. The results demonstrated that the heat budget in this region was a balance between surface heat forcing and ocean dynamic process. The mixing effect, especially the turbulent diffusion was the dominant component of ocean dynamic process, which played the key role in the dissipation of heat in this region. There was strong seasonal cycle in the temperature and heat budget of this region, which was driven by seasonality in heat flux and mixed layer depth. During the spring and summer, the mixed layer depth (MLD) became very shallow and stable, and the surface forcing was the main factor in control- ling the temporal variability of mixed layer temperature (MLT). Meanwhile the ocean dynamic process was rela- tively weak, of which the mixing was the main component. During the autumn and winter, a dramatic cooling effect on surface leaded to the quick deepening of MLD and subduction, making the vertical entrainment into the principal component of ocean dynamic process. On the contrary, although the mixing effect was still very important, its pro- portion becomes much smaller than that in spring and summer. The lagged correlation between PDO and heat budget in this region indicated that the MLT contained significant PDO signal. The correlation coefficient between the annual variability of heat budget and the temporal tendency of PDO was −0.84. The temporal tendency of PDO was also found to be highly correlated to most components of the heat budget. It was shown from the high correla- tion to the surface forcing that the surface forcing might have important effect on the evolution of PDO. It was suggested from the high correlation to the vertical entrainment that the subducted CMW was very possible to carry the PDO signal. As the main ocean dynamic processes, the mixing and advection seemed to be passively reacted to the variability of PDO.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyrath, T.</author><author>van Dam, T.</author><author>Weigelt, M.</author><author>Cheng, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An assessment of degree-2 Stokes coefficients from Earth rotation data</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><pages>249-259</pages><volume>195</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Earth rotation variations</keyword><keyword>Geopotential theory</keyword><keyword>Satellite geodesy</keyword><keyword>Time variable gravity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0956-540x</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/gji/ggt263</electronic-resource-num><notes>Meyrath, T., van Dam, T., Weigelt, M., &amp;amp; Cheng, M.

Here we derive changes in these coefficients for the period 2003 January-2012 April using Earth rotation data. Earth rotation data contain contributions from motion terms (the effects of winds and currents) and contributions from the effects of mass redistribution. We remove the effects of tides, atmospheric winds and oceanic currents from our data. We compare two different models of atmospheric and oceanic angular momentum for removing the effects of winds and currents: (1) using products from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and (2) using data from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We assess the quality of these motion models by comparing the two resulting sets of degree-2 Stokes coefficients to independent degree-2 estimates from satellite laser ranging (SLR), GRACE and a geophysical loading model. We find a good agreement between the coefficients from Earth rotation and the coefficients from other sources. In general, the agreement is better for the coefficients we obtain by removing winds and currents effects using the ECMWF model. In this case, we find higher correlations with the independent models and smaller scatters in differences. This fact holds in particular for {Delta}C20 and {Delta}C21, whereas we cannot observe a significant difference for {Delta}S21. At the annual and semiannual periods, our Earth rotation derived coefficients agree well with the estimates from the other sources, particularly for {Delta}C21 and {Delta}S21. The slight discrepancies we obtain for {Delta}C20 can probably be explained by errors in the atmospheric models and are most likely the result of an over-/underestimation of the annual and semiannual contributions of atmospheric winds to the length-of-day excitation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gierach, Michelle M.</author><author>Vazquez-Cuervo, Jorge</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Tsontos, Vardis M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aquarius and SMOS detect effects of an extreme Mississippi River flooding event in the Gulf of Mexico</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>5188-5193</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/grl.50995</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gierach, M.

This method allows the estimation of the variance of the errors of each technique, when the same quantity is monitored by three instruments with independent errors. Applied on a network of stations, several points of view can be considered: the technique level (in order to determine the error of each technique: GRACE, GPS and GCMs), the solution level (allowing to compare the precision of the same technique when different strategies/models are used), and the station level (in order to emphasize local anomalies and geographical patterns). In particular, our results show a precision of the loading vertical displacement at the level of 1 mm when using GRACE or the fluid models, and of 2 mm using GPS. We do not find significant differences between the precision of different solutions of the same techniques, even when there are strong differences in the data processing.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Speer, Kevin</author><author>Forget, Gael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global distribution and formation of mode waters</title><secondary-title>International Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>211-226</pages><volume>103</volume><edition>2</edition><keywords><keyword>Air-sea interaction</keyword><keyword>Large-scale hydrography</keyword><keyword>Mode water</keyword><keyword>Physical oceanography</keyword><keyword>Potential vorticity</keyword><keyword>Stratification</keyword><keyword>Water mass census</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd.</publisher><isbn>9780123918512</isbn><accession-num>26593692</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/B978-0-12-391851-2.00009-X</electronic-resource-num><notes>Speer, K., &amp;amp; Forget, G.

A new upper ocean water mass census based on observations from the Argo profiling float program is presented, to revisit Worthington's 1981 calculation exploiting the nearly global coverage and especially the wintertime resolution in these newer data, notably problematic with ship-based hydrography. Water mass volumes and stratification are calculated from the Argo data and used to describe the global distribution of mode waters and their seasonal cycle. Water mass transformation rates are derived from a global state-estimate of the ocean and air-sea fluxes and applied to mode water density classes, to infer formation rates and to relate these to seasonal volumetric changes. A conceptual framework has been applied to the generation of mode water in terms of PV fluxes at the sea surface; dynamical mechanisms relevant to the impact of mode waters on circulation are summarized. Some results with climate simulations are noted, for the role of mode water in climate variability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Landerer, Felix W.</author><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The anatomy of recent large sea level fluctuations in the Mediterranean Sea</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>553-557</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Mediterranean</keyword><keyword>ocean mass</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0094-8276</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/grl.50140</electronic-resource-num><notes>Landerer, F.

The non-seasonal anomalies were observed in sea surface height (from altimetry), as well as ocean mass (from gravimetry), indicating they were mostly of barotropic nature. These relatively rapid basin-wide fluctuations occurred over time scales of 1-5 months. Here we use observations and re-analysis data to attribute the non-seasonal sea level and ocean mass fluctuations in the Mediterranean Sea to concurrent wind stress anomalies over the adjacent subtropical Northeast Atlantic Ocean, just west of the Strait of Gibraltar, and extending into the strait itself. The observed Mediterranean sea level fluctuations are strongly anti-correlated with the monthly North-Atlantic-Oscillation (NAO) index. Citation: Landerer, F. W., and D. L.

The goal is to assess models' ability to simulate these deep circulations. The analysis reveals that models' deep temperatures are colder than the observations in the World Ocean Atlas, while most models' deep salinity values are higher than the observations, indicating models' deep water is generally colder and saltier than the reality. Moreover, there are long-term trends in both temperature and salinity simulations. The Luzon Strait transport below 1500 m is 0.36 Sv when averaged for all models, smaller compared with the observation, which is about 2.5 Sv. Four assimilated models and one unassimilated (OCCAM) display that the Luzon deep-layer overflow reaches its minimum in spring and its maximum in winter. The vertically integrated streamfunctions below 2400 m from these models show a deep cyclonic circulation in the SCS on a large scale)</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peralta Ferriz, Ana Cecilia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Arctic Ocean Circulation Patterns Revealed by Ocean Bottom Pressure Anomalies</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><notes>Peralta Ferriz, A.

These changes, which potentially affect global climate, are intimately linked to changes in the Arctic Ocean circulation. Thus, understanding Arctic Ocean circulation patterns is fundamental to monitoring and predicting the fate of the Arctic System. Since 2002, NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has provided continuous measurements of the time-varying gravity field of the Arctic Ocean. The gravitational variations represent mass variations, or the time-varying ocean bottom pressure (OBP) field. OBP variations are the sum of the mass change due to the sea surface height change and the integrated density variations through the water column. In this dissertation, &lt;italic&gt;in situ&lt;/italic&gt; and GRACE measurements of OBP anomalies, complemented by information from ocean models, are used to investigate the relative contribution of sea surface height and density-variations on the Arctic OBP field. The dynamics associated with the observed OBP changes are investigated. Major findings include the identification of three primary temporal-spatial modes of OBP variability at monthly to inter-annual timescales with the following characteristics: - Mode 1 is a wintertime basin-coherent Arctic mass change forced by southerly winds through Bering and Fram Straits. - Mode 2 reveals mass change along the Siberian shelves, driven by surface Ekman dynamics and associated with the Arctic Oscillation. - Mode 3 reveals a mass drop in Western Arctic shelves forced by the strengthening of the anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre, and wintertime along-shore westerly winds that increase OBP in the Eastern Arctic shelves. The OBP changes in the Kara Sea reveal a more baroclinic ocean character than modeling results have previously suggested, due to the complex bathymetry of this region and runoff-derived large density changes through the water column. This work integrates the character of the Arctic mass changes at different timescales, and provides information about the ocean mass re-distribution during years of rapidly thinning and disappearing seasonal sea ice.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Hsi-Yen</author><author>Mechoso, C.

The OBP observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) are used to calculate transport along the choke point between Antarctica and Australia. Statistical analysis will be conducted to determine the uncertainty of the GRACE observations using a simulated data set. There has been some evidence to suggest that Southern Hemisphere winds and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) or the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) play a significant role in accelerating/decelerating ACC transport, along with some contribution from buoyancy forcing. We will examine whether average zonal wind stress, wind stress curl, local zonal winds, or the SAM are representative of the low frequency zonal mass transport variability. Preliminary studies suggest that seasonal variation in transport across the Australia-Antarctica choke point is driven by winds along and north of the northern front of the ACC, the Sub Tropical front (STF). It also appears that interannual variations in transport are related to wind variations centered south of the Sub Antarctic Front (SAF). We have observed a strong negative correlation/positive correlation across the STF of the ACC in the Indian Ocean, which suggests wind stress curl may also be responsible for transport variations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Hsi-Yen</author><author>Xiao, Heng</author><author>Mechoso, C.

Monitoring the global distribution and long-term variations of CO2 sources and sinks is required for characterizing the global carbon budget. Total column measurements are useful for estimating regional-scale fluxes; however, model transport remains a significant error source, particularly for quantifying local sources and sinks. To improve the capability of estimating regional fluxes, we estimate lower tropospheric CO2 concentrations from ground-based near-infrared (NIR) measurements with space-based thermal infrared (TIR) measurements. The NIR measurements are obtained from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) of solar measurements, which provide an estimate of the total CO2 column amount. Estimates of tropospheric CO2 that are co-located with TCCON are obtained by assimilating Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) free tropospheric CO2 estimates into the GEOS-Chem model. We find that quantifying lower tropospheric CO2 by subtracting free tropospheric CO2 estimates from total column estimates is a linear problem, because the calculated random uncertainties in total column and lower tropospheric estimates are consistent with actual uncertainties as compared to aircraft data. For the total column estimates, the random uncertainty is about 0.55 ppm with a bias of −5.66 ppm, consistent with previously published results. After accounting for the total column bias, the bias in the lower tropospheric CO2 estimates is 0.26 ppm with a precision (one standard deviation) of 1.02 ppm. This precision is sufficient for capturing the winter to summer variability of approximately 12 ppm in the lower troposphere; double the variability of the total column. This work shows that a combination of NIR and TIR measurements can profile CO2 with the precision and accuracy needed to quantify lower tropospheric CO2 variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Two Decades of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: Anatomy, Variations, Extremes, Prediction, and Overcoming Its Limitations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>7167-7186</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate predict</keyword><keyword>Meridional overturning circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00478.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., &amp;amp; Heimbach, P.

Apart from a weak increasing trend at high northern latitudes, the AMOC appears statistically stable over the last 19 yr with fluctuations indistinguishable from those of a stationary Gaussian stochastic process. This characterization makes it possible to study (using highly developed tools) extreme values, predictability, and the statistical significance of apparent trends. Gaussian behavior is consistent with the central limit theorem for a process arising from numerous independent disturbances. In this case, generators include internal instabilities, changes in wind and buoyancy forcing fields, boundary waves, the Gulf Stream and deep western boundary current transports, the interior fraction in Sverdrup balance, and all similar phenomena arriving as summation effects from long distances and times. As a zonal integral through the sum of the large variety of physical processes in the three-dimensional ocean circulation, understanding of the AMOC, if it is of central climate importance, requires breaking it down into its unintegrated components over the entire basin.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Straneo, Fiammetta</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Sergienko, Olga</author><author>Hamilton, Gordon</author><author>Catania, Ginny</author><author>Griffies, Stephen</author><author>Hallberg, Robert</author><author>Jenkins, Adrian</author><author>Joughin, Ian</author><author>Motyka, Roman</author><author>Pfeffer, W.

The widespread, near-synchronous glacier retreat, and its coincidence with a period of oceanic and atmospheric warming, suggests a common climate driver. Evidence points to the marine margins of these glaciers as the region from which changes propagated inland. Yet, the forcings and mechanisms behind these dynamic responses are poorly understood and are either missing or crudely parameterized in climate and ice sheet models. Resulting projected sea level rise contributions from Greenland by 2100 remain highly uncertain.

After formation, the different AABW varieties cross the Southern Ocean and flow into the subtropical abyssal basins. It is shown here, using the analysis of Lagrangian trajectories within the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) model, that the pathways of the different sources of AABW have to a large extent amalgamated into one pathway by the time it reaches 31{\textdegree}S in the deep subtropical basins. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current appears to play an important role in the amalgamation, as 70% of the AABW completes at least one circumpolar loop before reaching the subtropical basins. This amalgamation of AABW pathways suggests that on decadal to centennial time scales, changes to properties and formation rates in any of the AABW source regions will be conveyed to all three subtropical abyssal basins.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanchez-Reales, J M</author><author>Vigo, M I</author><author>Jin, S</author><author>Chao, B F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Surface Geostrophic Ocean Currents Derived from Satellite Altimetry and GOCE Geoid</title><secondary-title>Marine Geodesy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine Geodesy</full-title></periodical><pages>175-189</pages><volume>35</volume><keywords><keyword>GOCE</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>drifters</keyword><keyword>geostrophic currents</keyword><keyword>jet</keyword><keyword>mean dynamic topography</keyword><keyword>mission</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean dynamic topography</keyword><keyword>recovery</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific</keyword><keyword>velocity</keyword><keyword>wind</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01490419.2012.718696</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sanchez-Reales, J.

Here we calculate the Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) by subtracting the geoid height determined by the GOCE satellite mission from the Mean Sea Surface Topography (MSST) derived from multi-satellite ocean altimetry (T/P, Jason 1/2, ERS-1/2, GEOSAT). Results for SGC are compared with those obtained from a GRACE-based mean geoid, as well as with the mean circulation patterns from measurements done by in situ drifter buoys and from simulations of the ECCO Ocean General Circulation Model. We found GOCE-based geoid solution clearly leads to significant improvements in the spatial resolution of SGC globally except in the Equatorial band where special filtering may be needed, with current velocities and spatial patterns closest to the in situ measurements of currents, compared with the GRACE-based results or ECCO model simulations that give significantly weaker Values with lower spatial resolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Ward, B A</author><author>Monteiro, F</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interconnection of nitrogen fixers and iron in the Pacific Ocean: Theory and numerical simulations</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>26</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4815 Ecosystems</keyword><keyword>4845 Nutrients and nutrient cycling</keyword><keyword>4855 Phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>and modeling</keyword><keyword>biogeographical provinces</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>iron cycle</keyword><keyword>marine nitrogen fixers</keyword><keyword>nitrogen cycle</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword><keyword>resource competition</keyword><keyword>structure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GB004039</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dutkiewicz, S., B.

We present a theoretical framework which considers the competition for iron and nitrogen resources between phytoplankton to explain where nitrogen fixing autotrophs (diazotrophs, which require higher iron quotas, and have slower maximum growth) can co-exist with other phytoplankton. The framework also indicates that iron and fixed nitrogen concentrations can be strongly controlled by the local phytoplankton community. Together with results from a three-dimensional numerical model, we characterize three distinct biogeochemical provinces: 1) where iron supply is very low diazotrophs are excluded, and iron-limited nondiazotrophic phytoplankton control the iron concentrations; 2) a transition region where nondiazotrophic phytoplankton are nitrogen limited and control the nitrogen concentrations, but the iron supply is still too low relative to nitrate to support diazotrophy; 3) where iron supplies increase further relative to the nitrogen source, diazotrophs and other phytoplankton coexist; nitrogen concentrations are controlled by nondiazotrophs and iron concentrations are controlled by diazotrophs. The boundaries of these three provinces are defined by the rate of supply of iron relative to the supply of fixed nitrogen. The numerical model and theory provide a useful tool to understand the state of, links between, and response to changes in iron supply and phytoplankton community structure that have been suggested by observations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, M R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the sensitivity of the Drake Passage transport to air-sea momentum flux</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>2279-2290</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>annular mode</keyword><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>driven circulations</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>part i</keyword><keyword>project</keyword><keyword>southern-hemisphere winds</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jcli-d-11-00030.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mazloff, M.

The transport is found to be sensitive to wind stress perturbations both along the ACC path and also in remote regions. The time scale of influence of wind stress perturbations is on the order of 100 days. Regarding spatial scales, the sensitivity of transport to wind stress is relatively smooth in regions of flat topography. In boundary regions and regions with complex topography, however, the sensitivity is enhanced and characterized by shorter length scales of order 100 km. Positive perturbations to the zonal wind stress usually increase the ACC transport, though the wind stress curl is of primary influence where the currents are steered by topography. Highlighting locations where the ACC is especially responsive to air-sea momentum fluxes reveals where an accurate determination of atmospheric winds may best enhance ocean modeling efforts.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zanna, L</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Moore, A M</author><author>Tziperman, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Upper-ocean singular vectors of the North Atlantic climate with implications for linear predictability and variability</title><secondary-title>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>500-513</pages><volume>138</volume><issue>663</issue><keywords><keyword>decadal prediction</keyword><keyword>error growth</keyword><keyword>heat content</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>model initialization</keyword><keyword>optimal perturbations</keyword><keyword>sensitivity analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/qj.937</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zanna, L., P.

Singular vectors (optimal perturbations) are calculated using the GCM, its tangent linear and adjoint models to determine an upper bound on the predictability of North Atlantic climate. The maximum growth time-scales of MOC and upper-ocean temperature anomalies, excited by the singular vectors, are 18.5 and 13 years respectively and in part explained by the westward propagation of upper-ocean anomalies against the mean flow. As a result of the linear interference of non-orthogonal eigenmodes of the non-normal dynamics, the ocean dynamics are found to actively participate in the significant growth of the anomalies. An initial density perturbation of merely 0.02 kg m−3 is found to lead to a 1.7 Sv MOC anomaly after 18.5 years. In addition, Northern Hemisphere upper-ocean temperature perturbations can be amplified by a factor of 2 after 13 years. The growth of upper-ocean temperature and MOC anomalies is slower and weaker when excited by the upper-ocean singular vectors than when the deep ocean is perturbed. This leads to the conclusion that predictability experiments perturbing only the atmospheric initial state may overestimate the predictability time. Interestingly, optimal MOC and upper-ocean temperature excitations are only weakly correlated, thus limiting the utility of SST observations to infer MOC variability. The excitation of anomalies in this model might have a crucial impact on the variability and predictability of Atlantic climate. The limit of predictability of the MOC is found to be different from that of the upper-ocean heat content, emphasizing that errors in ocean initial conditions will affect various measures differently and such uncertainties should be carefully considered in decadal prediction experiments.

This view is based in part on modeling studies of wind-driven sea level changes along the tropical Pacific. However, because buoyancy forcing (and other generating mechanisms) are usually ignored, this paradigm may overemphasize the role of winds. Focusing on the southeast tropical Pacific, we use a data-constrained ocean state estimate to demonstrate that distinct mechanisms—including the ocean's response to buoyancy forcing as well as nonlinear processes—can also contribute to interannual sea level variability. Contrary to the notion that buoyancy-driven sea level changes are dynamically passive, such changes exhibit a strongly nonlocal, dynamically active character, made manifest in westward propagating waves. As similar findings apply elsewhere, accurate modeling of interannual-to-decadal regional sea level changes requires consideration of a variety of forcing mechanisms, including, but not limited to, the winds.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decadal ocean (and ice) state estimation for climate research: What are the needs?</title><secondary-title>Oberwolfach Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oberwolfach Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>3451-3454</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4171/OWR/2012/58</electronic-resource-num><notes>Heimbach, P., and C.

The simulation, provided by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2) project, qualitatively reproduces the observed warming of subsurface waters in the subpolar gyre associated with changes of the North Atlantic atmospheric state that occurred in the mid-1990s. The modeled subsurface ocean temperature warmed by 1.5°C in southeast and southwest Greenland during 1994-2005 and subsequently cooled by 0.5°C; modeled subsurface ocean temperature increased by 2-2.5°C in central and then northwest Greenland during 1997-2005 and stabilized thereafter, while it increased after 2005 by &lt;0.5°C in north Greenland. Comparisons with in situ measurements off the continental shelf in the Labrador and Irminger Seas indicate that the model initial conditions were 0.4°C too warm in the south but the simulated warming is correctly reproduced; while measurements from eastern Baffin Bay reveal that the model initial conditions were 1.0°C too cold in the northwest but the simulated ocean warming brought modeled temperature closer to observations, i.e. the simulated warming is 1.0°C too large. At several key locations, the modeled oceanic changes off the shelf and below the seasonal mixed layer were rapidly transmitted to the shelf within troughs towards (model-unresolved) fjords. Unless blocked in the fjords by shallow sills, these warm subsurface waters had potential to propagate down the fjords and melt the glacier fronts. Based on model sensitivity simulations from an independent study (Xu and others, 2012), we show that the oceanic changes have very likely increased the subaqueous melt rates of the glacier fronts, and in turn impacted the rates of glacier flow.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hill, C</author><author>Ferreira, D</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Marshall, J</author><author>Abernathey, R</author><author>Barrier, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Controlling spurious diapycnal mixing in eddy-resolving height-coordinate ocean models - Insights from virtual deliberate tracer release experiments</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>14-26</pages><volume>45-46</volume><keywords><keyword>Adiabatic</keyword><keyword>Advection</keyword><keyword>Diapyncnal mixing</keyword><keyword>Numerical mixing</keyword><keyword>Ocean modeling</keyword><keyword>Southern</keyword><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>conservation</keyword><keyword>numerical advection</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>parameterization</keyword><keyword>pycnocline</keyword><keyword>schemes</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword><keyword>transport</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2011.12.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hill, C., D.

It is demonstrated that tracer advection schemes developed by Prather and collaborators for application in the stratosphere, greatly improve the fidelity of eddying flows, reducing levels of spurious diapycnal mixing to below those directly measured in field experiments, similar to 1 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1). This approach yields a model in which geostrophic eddies are quasi-adiabatic in the ocean interior, so that the residual-mean overturning circulation aligns almost perfectly with density contours. A reentrant channel configuration of the MIT General Circulation Model, that approximates the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, is used to examine these issues. Virtual analogs of ocean deliberate tracer release field experiments reinforce our conclusion, producing passive tracer solutions that parallel field experiments remarkably well.

While atmospheric effects dominate changes in the Earth's rate of rotation and hence length-of-day (LOD) on these time scales, the addition of oceanic angular momentum (OAM) estimates has been shown to improve closure of the LOD budget in a statistical sense. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the signature of a specific, sub-monthly ocean current fluctuation on the Earth's rotation rate, coinciding with recently-reported anomalies which developed in southeast Pacific surface temperature and bottom pressure fields during late 2009. Our results show that concurrent variations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which saw a sharp drop and recovery in zonal transport during a two-week period in November, were strong enough to cause a detectable change in LOD following the removal of atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) computed from the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) database. The strong OAM variations driving the LOD-AAM changes were diagnosed from ocean state estimates of the Consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) and involved roughly equal contributions from the current and pressure terms, with in situ confirmation for the latter provided by tide-corrected bottom pressure recorder data from the South Drake Passage site of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current Levels by Altimetry and Island Measurements (ACCLAIM) network.

This study couples estimates of circumpolar riverine nutrient fluxes from the PARTNERS (Pan-Arctic River Transport of Nutrients, Organic Matter, and Suspended Sediments) Project with a regionally configured version of the MIT general circulation model to develop estimates of the distribution and availability of dissolved riverine N in the Arctic Ocean, assess its importance for primary production, and compare these estimates to potential bacterial production fueled by riverine C. Because riverine dissolved organic nitrogen is remineralized slowly, riverine N is available for uptake well into the open ocean. Despite this, we estimate that even when recycling is considered, riverine N may support 0.5–1.5 Tmol C year−1 of primary production, a small proportion of total Arctic Ocean photosynthesis. Rapid uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen coupled with relatively high rates of dissolved organic nitrogen regeneration in N-limited nearshore regions, however, leads to potential localized rates of riverine-supported photosynthesis that represent a substantial proportion of nearshore production.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Feng, W</author><author>Zhong, M</author><author>Xu, H Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sea level variations in the South China Sea inferred from satellite gravity, altimetry, and oceanographic data</title><secondary-title>Science China-Earth Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science China-Earth Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1696-1701</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>annual cycle</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>inference</keyword><keyword>mass</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>sea level variation</keyword><keyword>surface height</keyword><keyword>the South China Sea</keyword><keyword>topex/poseidon</keyword><keyword>trends</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11430-012-4394-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Feng, W., M.

These two components of SLV in the South China Sea (SCS) are studied by using satellite altimetry, GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite gravity, and oceanographic data on annual and inter-annual timescales. On the annual timescale, the geographic distribution of mass-induced SLV's amplitude jointly estimated from altimetry and the ECCO (Estimation of the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) model agrees very well with that from GRACE. GRACE observes obvious seasonal mass-induced SLV in the SCS with annual amplitude of 2.7 +/- 0.4 cm, which is consistent with the annual amplitude of 2.7 +/- 0.3 cm estimated from the steric-corrected altimetry. On the inter-annual timescales, the mean SLV in the SCS shows a large oscillation, which is mainly caused by the steric effect. The trend of mean SLV inferred from altimetry in the SCS is 5.5 +/- 0.7 mm/yr for the period of 1993-2009, which is significantly higher than the global sea level rise rate of 3.3 +/- 0.4 mm/yr in the same period. There is no obvious trend signal in the mass-induced SLV detected from GRACE that indicates the water exchange between the SCS and its adjacent seas and land is in balance within the study period.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Losch, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adjoint sensitivities of sub-ice-shelf melt rates to ocean circulation under the Pine Island Ice Shelf, West Antarctica</title><secondary-title>Annals of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>59-69</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>60</issue><keywords><keyword>assimilation</keyword><keyword>basal</keyword><keyword>bottom topography</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>glacier</keyword><keyword>greenland</keyword><keyword>grounding line</keyword><keyword>meteorological observations</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/2012/AoG60A025</electronic-resource-num><notes>Heimbach, P., and M.

The adjoint code is based on algorithmic differentiation (AD) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's ocean general circulation model (MITgcm). The adjoint model was extended by adding into the AD process the corresponding sub-ice-shelf cavity code, which implements a three-equation thermodynamic melt-rate parameterization to infer heat and freshwater fluxes at the ice-shelf/ocean boundary. The inferred sensitivities reveal dominant timescales of 30 60 days over which the shelf exit is connected to the deep interior via advective processes. They exhibit rich three-dimensional time-evolving patterns that can be understood in terms of a combination of the buoyancy forcing by inflowing water masses, the cavity geometry and the effect of rotation and topography in steering the flow in the presence of prominent features in the bedrock bathymetry. Dominant sensitivity pathways are found over a sill, as well as 'shadow regions' of very low sensitivities. To the extent that these transient patterns are robust they carry important information for decision-making in observation deployment and monitoring.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ward, B A</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Jahn, O</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A size-structured food-web model for the global ocean</title><secondary-title>Limnology and Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Limnology and Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1877-1891</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4319/lo.2012.57.6.1877</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ward, B.

Physiological and ecological traits of the organisms are constrained by relationships with cell size. The model qualitatively reproduces global distributions of nutrients, biomass, and primary productivity, and captures the power-law relationship between cell size and numerical density, which has realistic slopes of between −1.3 and −0.8. We use the model to explore the global structure of marine ecosystems, highlighting the importance of both nutrient and grazer controls. The model suggests that zooplankton : phytoplankton (Z : P) biomass ratios may vary from an order of 0.1 in the oligotrophic gyres to an order of 10 in upwelling and high-latitude regions. Global estimates of the strength of bottom-up and top-down controls within plankton size classes suggest that these large-scale gradients in Z : P ratios are driven by a shift from strong bottom-up, nutrient limitation in the oligotrophic gyres to the dominance of top-down, grazing controls in more productive regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Graven, H D</author><author>Gruber, N</author><author>Key, R</author><author>Khatiwala, S</author><author>Giraud, X</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changing controls on oceanic radiocarbon: New insights on shallow-to-deep ocean exchange and anthropogenic CO2 uptake</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><keywords><keyword>atlantic-ocean</keyword><keyword>carbon-cycle</keyword><keyword>gas-exchange</keyword><keyword>indian-ocean</keyword><keyword>north pacific</keyword><keyword>northwestern pacific</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>recent climate-change</keyword><keyword>resolution coral record</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012jc008074</electronic-resource-num><notes>Graven, H.

While the oceanic uptake of bomb-derived C-14 was primarily controlled by air-sea exchange in the early decades after the bomb spike, we demonstrate that changes in oceanic C-14 are now primarily controlled by shallow-to-deep ocean exchange, i.e., the same mechanism that governs anthropogenic CO2 uptake. This is a result of accumulated bomb C-14 uptake that has rapidly decreased the air-sea gradient of C-14/C (Delta C-14) and shifted the main reservoir of bomb C-14 from the atmosphere to the upper ocean. The air-sea Delta C-14 gradient, reduced further by fossil fuel dilution, is now weaker than before weapons testing in most regions. Oceanic C-14, and particularly its temporal change, can now be used to study the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. We examine observed changes in oceanic Delta C-14 between the WOCE/SAVE (1988-1995) and the CLIVAR (2001-2007) eras and simulations with two ocean general circulation models, the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) and the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Model (ECCO). Observed oceanic Delta C-14 and its changes between the 1980s-90s and 2000s indicate that shallow-to-deep exchange is too efficient in ECCO and too sluggish in CCSM. These findings suggest that mean global oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 between 1990 and 2007 is bounded by the ECCO-based estimate of 2.3 Pg C yr(-1) and the CCSM-based estimate of 1.7 Pg C yr(-1)</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schodlok, Michael P</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Rignot, Eric</author><author>Studinger, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sensitivity of the ice-shelf/ocean system to the sub-ice-shelf cavity shape measured by NASA IceBridge in Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica</title><secondary-title>Annals of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>156-162</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>60</issue><keywords><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>beneath</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>thickness</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/2012AoG60A073</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schodlok, M.

The first simulation uses BEDMAP bathymetry under the Pine Island ice shelf, and the second simulation uses NASA IceBridge-derived bathymetry. The IceBridge data reveal the existence of a trough from the ice-shelf edge to the grounding line, enabling warm Circumpolar Deep Water to penetrate to the grounding line, leading to higher melt rates than previously estimated. The mean melt rate for the simulation with NASA IceBridge data is 28 ma –1 , much higher than previous model estimates but closer to estimates from remote sensing. Although the mean melt rate is 25% higher than in the simulation with BEDMAP bathymetry, the temporal evolution remains unchanged between the two simulations. This indicates that temporal variability of melting is mostly driven by processes outside the cavity. Spatial melt rate patterns of BEDMAP and IceBridge simulations differ significantly, with the latter in closer agreement with satellite-derived melt rate estimates of ~50ma –1 near the grounding line. Our simulations confirm that knowledge of the cavity shape and its time evolution are essential to accurately capture basal mass loss of Antarctic ice shelves.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soto-Navarro, F Javier</author><author>Criado-Aldeanueva, Francisco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Model Thermohaline Trends in the Mediterranean Sea during the Last Years: A Change with Respect to the Last Decades?</title><secondary-title>The Scientific World Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Scientific World Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>8</pages><volume>2012</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1100/2012/365698</electronic-resource-num><notes>Soto-Navarro, F.

Some changes with respect to the second half of the 20th century have been observed: the cooling of the upper waters of the entire eastern basin since 1950 seems to have vanished; the warming of WMDW historically reported for the second half of the last century could have reversed, although there is no agreement between both models at this point (trends of different sign are predicted); the salinification of WMDW reported for the previous decades is not observed in the south-westernmost area in the period 93–09, and a clear change from positive to negative in the steric sea level trend with respect to the period 93–05 is detected due to the sharp decreasing steric sea level of years 02–06.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yan, Y F</author><author>Xu, D Z</author><author>Qi, Y Q</author><author>Gan, Z J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observations of Freshening in the Northwest Pacific Subtropical Gyre near Luzon Strait</title><secondary-title>Atmosphere-Ocean</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Atmosphere-Ocean</full-title></periodical><pages>92-102</pages><volume>50</volume><keywords><keyword>Argo</keyword><keyword>Northwest Pacific</keyword><keyword>barrier layer</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>freshening</keyword><keyword>interannual variations</keyword><keyword>mixed-layer</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>precipitation</keyword><keyword>sea-surface salinity</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific</keyword><keyword>upper ocean</keyword><keyword>western equatorial pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07055900.2012.715078</electronic-resource-num><notes>Yan, Y.

Such freshening is also found in the outputs of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model. The possible mechanisms for the freshening are investigated using the surface freshwater flux (E-P) data, the ECCO outputs and a salt budget equation for the upper ocean. Our analysis indicates that the magnitude of the salinity change caused by the surface freshwater flux anomaly is far smaller than observed, suggesting that the surface freshwater flux anomaly is not sufficient to account for the observed freshening. In fact, the salinity anomaly is closely linked to a pronounced freshening at the northeast corner of the study area from 2003 to 2007. The advection of salinity anomalies in the western North Pacific Ocean between 25 degrees N and 35 degrees N via a southwestward flow in the &quot;C-shaped&quot; region associated with the Kuroshio system is the main mechanism responsible for the observed freshening in the study area.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Granskog, Mats A</author><author>Stedmon, Colin A</author><author>Dodd, Paul A</author><author>Amon, Rainer M W</author><author>Pavlov, Alexey K</author><author>de Steur, Laura</author><author>Hansen, Edmond</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Arctic outflow in the Fram Strait: Assessing the changes and fate of terrigenous CDOM in the Arctic Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>4808 Chemical tracers</keyword><keyword>9315 Arctic region</keyword><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>Fram Strait</keyword><keyword>absorption coefficient</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>chromophoric dissolved organic matter</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword><keyword>river water</keyword><keyword>spectral slope coefficient</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012JC008075</electronic-resource-num><notes>Granskog, M.

A pronounced CDOM absorption maximum between 30 and 120 m depth was associated with river and sea ice brine enriched water, characteristic of the Arctic mixed layer and upper halocline waters in the East Greenland Current (EGC). The lowest CDOM concentrations were found in the Atlantic inflow. We show that the salinity-CDOM relationship is not suitable for evaluating conservative mixing of CDOM. The strong correlation between meteoric water and CDOM is indicative of the riverine/terrigenous origin of CDOM in the EGC. Based on CDOM absorption in Polar Water and comparison with an Arctic river discharge weighted mean, we estimate that a 49–59% integrated loss of CDOM absorption across 250–600 nm has occurred. A preferential removal of absorption at longer wavelengths reflects the loss of high molecular weight material. In contrast, CDOM fluxes through the Fram Strait using September velocity fields from a high-resolution ocean–sea ice model indicate that the net southward transport of terrigenous CDOM through the Fram Strait equals up to 50% of the total riverine CDOM input; this suggests that the Fram Strait export is a major sink of CDOM. These contrasting results indicate that we have to constrain the (C)DOM budgets for the Arctic Ocean much better and examine uncertainties related to using tracers to assess conservative mixing in polar waters.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An assessment of deep steric height variability over the global ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>39</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>deep ocean</keyword><keyword>steric height</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GL050681</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

Results are based on monthly-averaged steric height anomalies, vertically integrated over the “unobserved” deep ocean (below ∼1700 m). Excluding linear trends, variability in deep steric height is typically 10–20% of that in the upper ocean, with larger values seen in extensive regions. Enhanced deep variability, at monthly to interannual time scales, occurs in areas of strong eddy energy. Deep signals are mostly thermosteric in nature, with halosteric contributions tightly correlated and generally compensating in the Atlantic and Indian oceans and adding in the Pacific. Potential inference of deep signals from knowledge of the upper ocean is hampered by poor correlations, and regressions based on upper ocean steric height fail to represent the estimated deep variability. Monthly sampling at ∼2° scales would allow for best determination of deep variability and long term trends.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Y</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Koppes, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Numerical experiments on subaqueous melting of Greenland tidewater glaciers in response to ocean warming and enhanced subglacial discharge</title><secondary-title>Annals of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>229-234</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>60</issue><keywords><keyword>alaska</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>fjord</keyword><keyword>ice shelf</keyword><keyword>runoff</keyword><keyword>sheet</keyword><keyword>terminus</keyword><keyword>waters</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/2012AoG60A139</electronic-resource-num><notes>Xu, Y., E.

Studies of ice-sheet/ocean interactions have mostly focused on melting beneath near-horizontal floating ice shelves. For tidewater glaciers, melting instead takes place along the vertical face of the calving front. Here we modify the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) to include ice melting from a calving face with the freshwater outflow at the glacier grounding line. We use the model to predict melt rates and their sensitivity to ocean thermal forcing and to subglacial discharge. We find that melt rates increase with approximately the one-third power of the subglacial water flux, and increase linearly with ocean thermal forcing. Our simulations indicate that, consistent with limited field data, melting ceases when subglacial discharge is shut off, and reaches several meters per day when subglacial discharge is high in the summer. These results are a first step toward a more realistic representation of subglacial discharge and of ocean thermal forcing on the subaqueous melting of tidewater glaciers in a numerical ocean model. Our results illustrate that the ice-front melting process is both complex and strongly time-dependent.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nastula, J</author><author>Gross, R</author><author>Salstein, D A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic excitation of polar motion: Identification of specific oceanic areas important for polar motion excitation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>16-23</pages><volume>62</volume><keywords><keyword>Non-atmospheric excitation</keyword><keyword>Oceanic excitation</keyword><keyword>atmospheric angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>chandler-wobble</keyword><keyword>earth</keyword><keyword>models</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jog.2012.01.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nastula, J., R.

The influence of different geographic regions of the ocean on the excitation of polar motion is determined by calculating correlations and covariances between these regional excitations and either the global non-atmospheric excitation or the global oceanic excitation. The non-atmospheric excitation is estimated by subtracting the atmospheric signal from the excitation computed from geodetic observations of polar motion; the global oceanic excitation function is equivalent to the sum of the oceanic excitation function computed in every grid point. Our attention focuses on the regional distribution of the oceanic polar motion excitation for two time scales: the seasonal spectral band and the band around the Chandler period. We identified the southern Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean as important regions for non-atmospheric polar motion excitation. The maximum of variability over the southern Indian Ocean is especially important in the case of annual oscillation. The Atlantic Ocean makes less significant contribution to the non-atmospheric polar motion excitation than the Pacific and Indian Ocean in both considered spectral ranges. Inland seas like the Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan have high covariance with the global signals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The prevailing hypothesis, proposed by Broecker et al. [1989 Nature 341:318–321] more than two decades ago, suggests that an abrupt rerouting of Lake Agassiz overflow through the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Valley inhibited deep water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic and weakened the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). More recently, Tarasov and Peltier [2005 Nature 435:662–665] showed that meltwater could have discharged into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie Valley ∼4,000 km northwest of the St. Lawrence outlet. Here we use a sophisticated, high-resolution, ocean sea-ice model to study the delivery of meltwater from the two drainage outlets to the deep water formation regions in the North Atlantic. Unlike the hypothesis of Broecker et al., freshwater from the St. Lawrence Valley advects into the subtropical gyre ∼3,000 km south of the North Atlantic deep water formation regions and weakens the AMOC by &lt;15%. In contrast, narrow coastal boundary currents efficiently deliver meltwater from the Mackenzie Valley to the deep water formation regions of the subpolar North Atlantic and weaken the AMOC by &gt;30%. We conclude that meltwater discharge from the Arctic, rather than the St. Lawrence Valley, was more likely to have triggered the Younger Dryas cooling.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Dam, T</author><author>Collilieux, X</author><author>Wuite, J</author><author>Altamimi, Z</author><author>Ray, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nontidal ocean loading: amplitudes and potential effects in GPS height time series</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodesy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodesy</full-title></periodical><pages>1043-1057</pages><volume>86</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Annual signals</keyword><keyword>Height coordinate time series</keyword><keyword>Loading effects</keyword><keyword>Ocean bottom pressure</keyword><keyword>deformation</keyword><keyword>displacements</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>region</keyword><keyword>solid earth</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00190-012-0564-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>van Dam, T., X.

The only previous global analysis investigating the magnitude of OBP surface displacements used older OBP data sets (van Dam et al. in J Geophys Res 129:507-517, 1997). Since then significant improvements in meteorological forcing models used to predict OBP have been made, augmented by observations from satellite altimetry and expendable bathythermograph profiles. Using more recent OBP estimates from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) project, we reassess the amplitude of the predicted effect of OBP on the height coordinate time series from a global distribution of GPS stations. OBP-predicted loading effects display an RMS scatter in the height of between 0.2 and 3.7 mm, larger than previously reported but still much smaller (by a factor of 2) than the scatter observed due to atmospheric pressure loading. Given the improvement in GPS hardware and data analysis techniques, the OBP signal is similar to the precision of weekly GPS height coordinates. We estimate the effect of OBP on GPS height coordinate time series using the MIT reprocessed solution, mi1. When we compare the predicted OBP height time series with mi1, we find that the scatter is reduced over all stations by 0.1 mm on average with reductions as high as 0.7 mm at some stations. More importantly we are able to reduce the scatter on 65 % of the stations investigated. The annual component of the OBP signal is responsible for 80 % of the reduction in scatter on average. We find that stations located close to semi-enclosed bays or seas are affected by OBP loading to a greater extent than other stations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borstad, C P</author><author>Khazendar, A</author><author>Larour, E</author><author>Morlighem, M</author><author>Rignot, E</author><author>Schodlok, M P</author><author>Seroussi, Hélène</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A damage mechanics assessment of the Larsen B ice shelf prior to collapse: Toward a physically-based calving law</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>39</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>0728 Ice shelves</keyword><keyword>0732 Icebergs</keyword><keyword>0776 Glaciology</keyword><keyword>0798 Modeling</keyword><keyword>calving</keyword><keyword>damage mechanics</keyword><keyword>glaciology</keyword><keyword>inverse methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012GL053317</electronic-resource-num><notes>Borstad, C.

Here, we propose a calving framework based on continuum damage mechanics coupled with the equations of viscous deformation of glacier ice. We introduce a scalar damage variable that quantifies the loss of load-bearing surface area due to fractures and that feeds back with ice viscosity to represent fracture-induced softening. The calving law is a standard failure criterion for viscous damaging materials and represents a macroscopic brittle instability quantified by a critical or threshold damage. We constrain this threshold using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) by inverting for damage on the Larsen B ice shelf prior to its 2002 collapse. By analyzing the damage distribution in areas that subsequently calved, we conclude that calving occurs after fractures have reduced the load-bearing capacity of the ice by 60 ± 10%.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Pujol, M Isabelle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quality assessment of a satellite altimetry data product in the Nordic, Barents, and Kara seas</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4275 Remote sensing and electromagnetic processes</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>Arctic seas</keyword><keyword>Nordic seas</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword><keyword>surface drifters</keyword><keyword>tide gauges</keyword><keyword>validation of altimetry data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC007557</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

However, the high-latitude regions have traditionally been avoided due to the persistent sea ice cover. Most of the validation studies have focused on the areas below the polar circles. In this paper we examine the quality and performance of a gridded satellite altimetry product in the Nordic, Barents, and Kara seas. The altimetric sea level in coastal areas is validated using available tide gauge records. We show that at most locations in the Nordic seas the altimetry and tide gauge measurements are in a good agreement in terms of the root-mean square differences and the amplitudes and phases of the seasonal cycle. The agreement deteriorates in the shallow areas of the Barents and Kara seas subject to the seasonal presence of sea ice, and where the altimetry data are contaminated by the residual aliasing of unresolved high-frequency signals. The comparison of linear trends at the locations of tide gauges reveals discrepancies that need to be taken into account when interpreting long-term changes of sea level in the region. Away from the coast the altimetry data are compared to drifter trajectories, corrected for Ekman currents. The drifter trajectories are found consistent with the mesoscale variability of the altimetric sea level. This study provides the first comprehensive validation of a gridded satellite altimetry data product in the high-latitude seas.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Zlotnicki, Victor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performance of GOCE and GRACE-derived mean dynamic topographies in resolving Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts</title><secondary-title>Ocean Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>893-905</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10236-012-0541-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

The mean dynamic topography (MDT) is the difference between the time-averaged sea surface height and the geoid. The GOCE mission is aimed at determining the geoid with superior accuracy and spatial resolution, so that a more accurate MDT can be estimated. In this study, we determine the mean positions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts using the purely geodetic estimates of the MDT constructed from an altimetric mean sea surface and GOCE and GRACE geoids. Overall, the frontal positions obtained from the GOCE and GRACE MDTs are close to each other. This means that these independent estimates are robust and can potentially be used to validate frontal positions obtained from sparse and irregular in situ measurements. The geodetic frontal positions are compared to earlier estimates as well as to those derived from MDTs based on satellite and in situ measurements and those obtained from an ocean data synthesis product. The position of the Sub-Antarctic Front identified in the GOCE MDT is found to be in better agreement with the previous estimates than that identified in the GRACE MDT. The geostrophic velocities derived from the GOCE MDT are also closer to observations than those derived from the GRACE MDT. Our results thus show that the GOCE mission represents an improvement upon GRACE in terms of the time-averaged geoid.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prowe, A E Friederike</author><author>Pahlow, Markus</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Oschlies, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Top-down control of marine phytoplankton diversity in a global ecosystem model</title><secondary-title>Progress in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Progress in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>101</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pocean.2011.11.016</electronic-resource-num><notes>Prowe, A.

Realizing that biodiversity might influence the adaptation potential, recent model approaches have identified bottom-up controls on patterns of phytoplankton diversity regulated by nutrient availability and seasonality. Top-down control of biodiversity, however, has not been considered in depth in such models. Here we demonstrate how zooplankton predation with prey-ratio based food preferences can enhance phytoplankton diversity in a ecosystem-circulation model with self-assembling community structure. Simulated diversity increases more than threefold under preferential grazing relative to standard density-dependent predation, and yields better agreement with observed distributions of phytoplankton diversity. The variable grazing pressure creates refuges for less competitive phytoplankton types, which reduces exclusion and improves the representation of seasonal phytoplankton succession during blooms. The type of grazing parameterization also has a significant impact on primary and net community production. Our results demonstrate how a simple parameterization of a zooplankton community response affects simulated phytoplankton community structure, diversity and dynamics, and motivates development of more detailed representations of top-down processes essential for investigating the role of diversity in marine ecosystems.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, Christopher G</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Importance of Circulation Changes to Atlantic Heat Storage Rates on Seasonal and Interannual Time Scales</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>350-362</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Atlantic Ocean,Energy transport,Meridional overtur</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00123.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

The focus is on low- and midlatitude regions and on seasonal and interannual time scales. An estimate of the ocean state over 1993–2004, produced by a coarse-resolution general circulation model fit to observations via the method of Lagrange multipliers, is used. Meridional heat transports are first decomposed into contributions from time-mean and time-variable velocity and temperature and second from zonally symmetric baroclinic (overturning, including Ekman) and zonally asymmetric (gyre and other spatially correlated) circulations. Heat storage rates are then ascribed to ocean–atmosphere heat exchanges, diffusive mixing, and advective processes related to the various components of the meridional heat transport. Results show that seasonal heat storage changes generally represent a local response to surface heat inputs, but seasonal advective changes are also important near the equator. Interannual heat storage rate anomalies are mostly due to advection in tropical regions, whereas both surface heat fluxes and advection contribute at higher latitudes. Low-latitude advection can be primarily attributed to zonally symmetric baroclinic circulations, but temperature variations and zonally asymmetric flows can contribute elsewhere. A relationship between interannual heat storage rates in the equatorial Atlantic’s top 100 m and meridional heat transport associated with the zonally symmetric baroclinic flow is observed; however, due in part to the role of shallow advective processes at these latitudes, any direct relationship between sea surface temperature variability and heat transport changes associated with intermediate or deep meridional overturning circulations is not clear.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, A T</author><author>Kwok, R</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Source and Pathway of the Western Arctic Upper Halocline in a Data-Constrained Coupled Ocean and Sea Ice Model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>802-823</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>alaskan</keyword><keyword>chukchi shelf</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>coastal</keyword><keyword>continental-shelf</keyword><keyword>dense water formation</keyword><keyword>layer</keyword><keyword>offshore transport</keyword><keyword>polynyas</keyword><keyword>shallow</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo-d-11-040.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nguyen, A.

Two 1992-2008 data-constrained solutions at 9- and 4-km horizontal grid spacing show that 1) winter sea ice growth results in brine rejection and DW formation; 2) the DW flows primarily down Barrow and Central-Herald Canyons in the form of bottom-trapped, intermittent currents to depths of 50-150 m from the late winter to late summer seasons; and 3) eddies with diameters similar to 30 km carry the cold DW from the shelf break into the Canada Basin interior at depths of 50-150 m. The 4-km data-constrained solution does not show eddy transport across the Chukchi Shelf at shallow depths; instead, advection of DW downstream of polynya regions is driven by a strong (similar to 0.1 m s(-1)) mean current on the Chukchi Shelf. Upper halocline water (UHW) formation rate was obtained from two methods: one is based on satellite data and on a simple parameterized approach, and the other is computed from the authors' model solution. The two methods yield 5740 +/- 61420 km(3) yr(-1) and 4190-4860 +/- 61440 km(3) yr(-1), respectively. These rates imply a halocline replenishment period of 10-21 yr. Passive tracers also show that water with highest density forms in the Gulf of Anadyr and along the eastern Siberian coast immediately north of the Bering Strait. These results provide a coherent picture of the seasonal development of UHW at high spatial and temporal resolutions and serve as a guide for improving understanding of water-mass formation in the western Arctic Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, M D</author><author>Adkins, J F</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Schodlok, M P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of ocean cooling in setting glacial southern source bottom water salinity</title><secondary-title>Paleoceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Paleoceanography</full-title></periodical><volume>27</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4219 Continental shelf and slope processes</keyword><keyword>4283 Water masses</keyword><keyword>4926 Glacial</keyword><keyword>4962 Thermohaline</keyword><keyword>Antarctic Bottom Water</keyword><keyword>Last Glacial Maximum</keyword><keyword>Weddell Sea</keyword><keyword>ice shelves</keyword><keyword>salinity</keyword><keyword>sea ice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012PA002297</electronic-resource-num><notes>Miller, M.

Additionally, Glacial Southern Source Bottom Water (GSSBW) was saltier than Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), over and above the difference implied by the mean sea level change. This study examines to what extent cold temperatures, through their effect on ice formation and melting, could have caused these differences. Computational sensitivity experiments using a coupled ice shelf cavity–sea ice–ocean model are performed in a Weddell Sea domain, as a representative case study for bottom water formation originating from Antarctic continental shelves. Ocean temperatures at the domain open boundaries are systematically lowered to determine the sensitivity of Weddell Sea water mass properties to a range of cool ocean temperatures. The steady state salinities differ between experiments due to temperature-induced responses of ice shelf and sea ice melting and freezing, evaporation and open boundary fluxes. The results of the experiments indicate that reduced ocean temperature can explain up to 30% of the salinity difference between GSSBW and AABW, primarily due to decreased ice shelf melting. The smallest and most exposed ice shelves, which abut narrow continental shelves, have the greatest sensitivity to the ocean temperature changes, suggesting that at the LGM there could have been a shift in geographical site dominance in bottom water formation. More sea ice is formed and exported in the cold ocean experiments, but the effect of this on salinity is negated by an equal magnitude reduction in evaporation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Xuebin</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce</author><author>Roemmich, Dean</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sensitivity of Western Boundary Transport at the Mean North Equatorial Current Bifurcation Latitude to Wind Forcing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2056-2072</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-11-0229.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhang, X., B.

The elevation of the ocean surface, called ocean surface topography, has been measured by conventional nadir- looking radar altimeter for the past two decades. The data collected have been used for the study of large-scale circulation and sea level change. However, the spatial resolution of the observations has limited the study to scales larger than about 200 km, leaving the smaller scales containing substantial kinetic energy of ocean circulation that is responsible for the flux of heat, dissolved gas and nutrients between the upper and the deep ocean. This flux is important to the understanding of the ocean’s role in regulating future climate change. The elevation of the water bodies on land is a key parameter required for the computation of storage and discharge of freshwater in rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Globally, the spatial and temporal variability of water storage and discharge is poorly known due to the lack of well-sampled observations. In situ networks measuring river flows are declining worldwide due to economic and political reasons. Conventional altimeter observations suffers from the complexity of multiple peaks caused by the reflections from water, vegetation canopy and rough topography, resulting in much less valid data over land than over the ocean. Another major limitation is the large inter track distance preventing good coverage of rivers and other water bodies. This document provides descriptions of a new measurement technique using radar interferometry to obtain wide-swath measurement of water elevation at high resolution over both the ocean and land. Making this type of measurement, which addresses the shortcomings of conventional altimetry in both oceanographic and hydrologic applications, is the objective of a mission concept called Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), which was recommended by the National Research Council’s first decadal survey of NASA’s Earth science program. This document provides wide-ranging examples of research opportunities in oceanography and land hydrology that would be enabled by the new type of measurement. Additional applications in many other branches of Earth System science ranging from ocean bathymetry to sea ice dynamics are also discussed. Many of the technical issues in making the measurement are discussed as well. Also presented is a preliminary design of the SWOT Mission concept, which is being jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dayoub, N.</author><author>Edwards, S.

Gradient-based optimisation algorithms are the key to solve optimisation problems of prac- tical interest. The required derivatives can be efficiently computed with the adjoint approach. However, current methods for the development of adjoint models often require a significant amount of effort and expertise, in particular for non-linear time-dependent problems. This work presents a new high-level reinterpretation of algorithmic dif- ferentiation to develop adjoint models. This reinterpretation considers the discrete system as a sequence of equation solves. Applying this approach to a general finite-element framework results in an automatic and robust way of deriving and solving adjoint models. This drastically reduces the development effort compared to traditional methods. Based on this result, a new framework for rapidly defining and solving optimisation problems constrained by PDEs is developed. The user spec- ifies the discrete optimisation problem in a compact high-level language that resembles the mathematical structure of the underlying system. All remaining steps, including parameter updates, PDE solves and derivative computations, are performed without user intervention. The framework can be applied to a wide range of governing PDEs, and interfaces to various gradient-free and gradient-based optimisation algorithms. The capabilities of this framework are demonstrated through the applica- tion to two PDE-constrained optimisation problems. The first is concerned with the optimal layout of turbines in tidal stream farms; this optimisation problem is one of the main challenges facing the marine renewable energy iiiindustry. The second application applies data assimilation to reconstruct the profile of tsunami waves based on inundation observations. This pro- vides the first step towards the general reconstruction of tsunami signals from satellite information.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 1960 Perth to Bermuda antipodal acoustic propagation experiment : A measure of a half-century of ocean warming?</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 35th Scandinavian Symposium on Physical Acoustics, Geilo 29 January – 1 February</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 35th Scandinavian Symposium on Physical Acoustics, Geilo 29 January – 1 February</full-title></periodical><issue>April</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><notes>Dushaw, B.

A large part of the variations of the gravity field originate from hydrological mass changes on the continents. The dissertation discusses the determination of hydrological mass variations from GRACE for the Siberian water systems of the rivers Ob, Yenisey, Lena and Kolyma. The mass variations from GRACE data are combined with atmospheric data of the NCEP reanalysis to calculate the freshwater fluxes in the Arctic Ocean. The freshwater fluxes strongly influences the salinity and the oceanographic regime of the Arctic Ocean. In turn, the Arctic Ocean controls the global thermohaline circulation which is very important for the global climate. Because these large currents of the ocean influence the global climate, the changes of the freshwater fluxes in the Arctic Ocean are an important factor for the global climate change. The runoff can be measured pointwise with high temporal resolution, but measurements in the high latitudes are difficulty and expensive. Independent methods to measure the mass changes in the Arctic can help to determine the freshwater fluxes on large spatial scales, and contribute to understand the coupled and complex processes of the Arctic. Until present, the complex error structure of the GRACE data are not fully understand. The dissertation examines the errors and analysizes the leakage caused by the limited spectrum of the Stokes coefficients. A proposal for a solution will be discussed. The following steps are important: Expanding the GRACE data with adequate terms of degree one; Valuation of leakage errors because of the limited spectrum. Leakage due to oceanographic signals of the Arctic Ocean are small (&lt; 1 %). Leakage errors due to signals on land produces relative errors of basin averages of 8-17 %. Beyond that, the largest errors are caused by the coefficients of higher degree. Filtering is an effective method to damp the error signals. In addition to the common filters described in the literature, a filter method, called composite filter, was created. Significant structures from hydrological models can be deteceted in the GRACE data without any other filtering. Only the residual signals should be filtered by using one of the common filters. In comparison to the common filters, the composite filter represents the signal strength, the signal structures, the amplitude and the phase of the saisonal signal on the continents much better. Combining hydrological mass variations from GRACE data with atmospheric data (for example the NCEP reanalysis) the runoff of the four Siberian river systems can be calcu- lated. The validation of the calculated runoff using observations leads to a good agreement (83 % for Yenisey and Lena). Furthermore, it is possible to combine the runoff of a river system with measurements of water level and salinity in the Arctic Ocean. The high runoff of the Lena river system in spring is visible in the water level changes in the Laptev sea.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hobbs, Will R.</author><author>Willis, Joshua K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Midlatitude North Atlantic heat transport: A time series based on satellite and drifter data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><issue>C1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC007039</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hobbs, W.

Modeling these interactions requires parameterizing the turbulent boundary layer processes to infer melt rates from the oceanic state at the ice-ocean interface. Here we explore two such parameterizations in the context of the MIT ocean general circulation model coupled to the z-coordinates ice shelf cavity model of Losch (2008). We investigate both idealized ice shelf cavity geometries as well as a realistic cavity under Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIIS), West Antarctica. Our starting point is a three-equation melt rate parameterization implemented by Losch (2008), which is based on the work of Hellmer and Olbers (1989). In this form, the transfer coefficients for calculating heat and freshwater fluxes are independent of frictional turbulence induced by the proximity of the moving ocean to the fixed ice interface. More recently, Holland and Jenkins (1999) have proposed a parameterization in which the transfer coefficients do depend on the ocean-induced turbulence and are directly coupled to the speed of currents in the ocean mixed layer underneath the ice shelf through a quadratic drag formulation and a bulk drag coefficient. The melt rate parameterization in the MITgcm is augmented to account for this velocity dependence. First, the effect of the augmented formulation is investigated in terms of its impact on melt rates as well as on its feedback on the wider sub-ice shelf circulation. We find that, over a wide range of drag coefficients, velocity-dependent melt rates are more strongly constrained by the distribution of mixed layer currents than by the temperature gradient between the shelf base and underlying ocean, as opposed to velocity-independent melt rates. This leads to large differences in melt rate patterns under PIIS when including versus not including the velocity dependence. In a second time, the modulating effects of tidal currents on melting at the base of PIIS are examined. We find that the temporal variability of velocity-dependent melt rates under tidal forcing is greater than that of velocity-independent melt rates. Our experiments suggest that because tidal currents under PIIS are weak and buoyancy fluxes are strong, tidal mixing is negligible and tidal rectification is restricted to very steep bathymetric features, such as the ice shelf front. Nonetheless, strong tidally-rectified currents at the ice shelf front significantly increase ablation rates there when the formulation of the transfer coefficients includes the velocity dependence. The enhanced melting then feedbacks positively on the rectified currents, which are susceptible to insulate the cavity interior from changes in open ocean conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Power in Modeling Virtual Marine Microbes</title><secondary-title>Microbe Magazine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microbe Magazine</full-title></periodical><pages>314-319</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1128/microbe.7.314.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dutkiewicz, S.

We demon- strate this concept using existing ocean bottom pressure measurements from the region, from which we extract the annual cycle of ocean mass (amplitude 8.5 mm, peaking in late September), which is in agreement with previous determinations based on complex combinations of global data sets. This method sidesteps a number of limitations in satellite gravity-based calculations, but its direct implemen- tation is currently limited by the precision of pressure sen- sors, which suffer from significant drift. Development of a low-drift method to measure ocean bottom pressure at a few sites could provide an important geodetic constraint on the earth system. Citation: Hughes, C. W., M. E. Tamisiea, R. J.

The study involves a comparison of ‘geodetic’ and ‘ocean’ approaches to determination of the mean dynamic topography (MDT) at the coast, from which conödence in the accuracy of stateof-the-art ocean and geoid models can be obtained. We conclude that models are consistent at the sub-decimetre level for the regions that we have studied (North Atlantic coastlines and islands, North American Paciöc coast and Mediterranean). That level of consistency provides an estimate of the accuracy of using the ocean models to provide an MDT correction to the national datums of countries with coastlines, and thereby of achieving uniöcation. It also provides a validation of geoid model accuracy for application to height system uniöcation in general.

Several recent studies demonstrated that the combination of atmospheric and oceanic excitations contains enough power at the Chandler frequency and is significantly coherent with the observed free wobble. This paper is an extension of earlier studies by Brzezinski and Nastula (Adv Space Res 30:195-200, 2002), Brzezinski et al. (Oceanic excitation of the Chandler wobble using a 50-year time series of ocean angular momentum. In: Adam J, Schwarz K-P (eds) Vistas for geodesy in the new millennium. IAG Symposia, vol 125. Springer, Berlin, pp 434-439, 2002) using the same method of analysis but other available estimates of atmospheric and oceanic excitation of polar motion. We also try to assess the role of land hydrology in the excitation balance by taking into account the hydrological angular momentum estimates. Our results generally confirm earlier conclusions concerning the atmospheric and oceanic excitation. Adding the hydrological excitation is found to increase slightly the Chandler wobble excitation power, while the improvement of coherence depends on the geophysical models under consideration.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jahn, A.</author><author>Aksenov, Y.</author><author>de Cuevas, B.

Via interaction with the solid Earth, both matter and motion effects cause fluctuations in the direction of the Earth's rotation axis, signified as polar motion, as well as changes in the angular velocity, expressed, e.g. in terms of length of day (LOD). This paper gives an overview of the most important atmospheric and oceanic effects on polar motion and LOD from subdaily to multi-annual time scales and discusses the variable agreement between the observational evidence of excitation effects and their corresponding geophysical models. Special emphasis, including a brief synopsis of recent results, is placed on tidal phenomena and in particular on those caused by short period ocean tides.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Göttl, F.</author><author>Schmidt, M.</author><author>Heinkelmann, R.</author><author>Savcenko, R.</author><author>Bouman, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combination of gravimetric and altimetric space observations for estimating oceanic polar motion excitations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><issue>C10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012JC007915</electronic-resource-num><notes>Göttl, F., Schmidt, M., Heinkelmann, R., Savcenko, R., &amp;amp; Bouman, J.

The integral effect on Earth rotation of mass displacements and motion is therefore precisely known, but the separation of contributions from particular geodynamic processes remains a challenge. Here we show that the oceanic mass effect on Earth rotation can be derived from both time variable gravity field solutions from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and sea level anomalies (SLA) observed from satellite altimeter missions. The GRACE solutions require filtering and the application of an ocean mask, whereas the SLA need to be corrected for the steric effect as polar motion is only affected by mass redistributions. We assess the accuracy of our oceanic polar motion excitations by using GRACE and SLA solutions from different processing centers. In addition, we compare polar motion excitations from GRACE, satellite altimeter data and their combinations with excitations estimated from ocean models. We show that the combination of gravimetric and altimetric solutions reduces systematic errors of the individual solutions. The combined solutions are about 2 times more accurate than ocean model results and about 3 times more accurate than the so-called reduced geodetic excitation functions. We anticipate our analysis to be valuable input for improved modeling of oceanic mass redistributions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seoane, L.</author><author>Biancale, R.</author><author>Gambis, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Agreement between Earth's rotation and mass displacement as detected by GRACE</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>49-55</pages><volume>62</volume><keywords><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>Gravity field</keyword><keyword>Length-of-day</keyword><keyword>Polar motion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><isbn>0264-3707</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jog.2012.02.008</electronic-resource-num><notes>Seoane, L., Biancale, R., &amp;amp; Gambis, D.

The polar motion and length-of-day excitations determined from the spherical harmonics of the GRGS latest release (RL02) are explored and compared to the previous release (RL01). The RL02 gives best fit of the observed annual variations than RL01 and geophysical models do. However, the observed residual signal obtained after removing annual and semiannual oscillations is still better explained by the geophysical models even if RL02 estimates are improved at these frequencies scales. Linear trends are also estimated over study period (2003-2008). The linear trends of χ 1 based on GRACE RL01/02 and EOP are similar but they are very different for χ 2. Further studies with longer time series of GRACE and future gravimetric missions could help better interpret the long term variations and the effects of ice sheet mass loss or post glacial rebound. Concerning LOD variations, GRACE/LAGEOS mass displacement information brings better agreement with EOP observations, compared to the pressure term estimated by models, however the RL02 has not shown significant improvement. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, J.

Gravity change can be quantified by geodetic measurements and numerical climate models. We estimate time series of low-degree gravitational variations, ΔC21, ΔS21, and ΔC20 using four different techniques, from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Earth Orientation Parameters (length of day and polar motion), advanced climate models (including atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic models), and satellite laser ranging. We compare these independent estimates at different time scales, and discuss major uncertainties for the various techniques. Independent estimates of ΔC21, ΔS21, and ΔC20 are important for validating the geodetic techniques and for improving understanding of large scale and low frequency mass redistribution within the Earth system.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Calafat, F.

Our model of the Mf ocean tide assimilates more than 14 years of altimeter data from the Topex/Poseidon and Jason-1 satellites. Because the Mf altimetric signal-to-noise ratio is very small, it is critical that altimeter data not be overweighted. The polar motion data, plus tide-gauge data and independent altimeter data, give useful additional information, with only the polar motion putting constraints on tidal current velocities. The resulting ocean-tide model, plus the dominant elastic body tide, leaves a small residual in observed LOD caused by mantle anelasticity. The inferred effective tidal Q of the anelastic body tide is 90 and is in line with a ωα frequency dependence with α in the range 0.2–0.3.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenoglio-Marc, L.</author><author>Rietbroek, R.</author><author>Grayek, S.</author><author>Becker, M.</author><author>Kusche, J.</author><author>Stanev, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water mass variation in the Mediterranean and Black Seas</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>168-182</pages><volume>59-60</volume><keywords><keyword>Black Sea</keyword><keyword>GRACE</keyword><keyword>Mass change</keyword><keyword>Mediterranean Sea</keyword><keyword>Sea level</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><isbn>0264-3707</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jog.2012.04.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fenoglio-Marc, L., Rietbroek, R., Grayek, S., Becker, M., Kusche, J., &amp;amp; Stanev, E.

We construct in each basin two time series representing the basin mean mass signal in terms of equivalent water height. The first series is obtained from steric-corrected altimetry while the other is deduced from GRACE data corrected for the contamination by continental hydrology. The series show a good agreement in terms of annual and inter-annual signals, which is in line with earlier works, although different model corrections influence the consistency in terms of seasonal signal and trend. In the Mediterranean Sea, we obtain the best agreement using a steric correction from the regional oceanographic model MFSTEP and a continental hydrological leakage correction derived from the global continental hydrological model WaterGAP2. The inter-annual time series show a correlation of 0.85 and a root mean square (RMS) difference of 15. mm. The two estimates have similar accuracy and their annual amplitude and phase agree within 3. mm and 23 days respectively. The GRACE-derived mass-induced sea level variability yields an annual amplitude of 27 ± 5. mm peaking in December and a trend of 5.3 ± 1.9. mm/yr, which deviates within 3. mm/yr from the altimetry-derived estimate. In the Black Sea, the series are less consistent, with lower accuracy of the GRACE-derived estimate, but still show a promising agreement considering the smaller size of the basin. The best agreement is realized choosing the corrections from WaterGAP2 and from the regional oceanographic model NEMO. The inter-annual time series have a correlation and RMS differences of 0.68 and 55. mm, their annual amplitude and phase agree within 4. mm and 6 days respectively. The GRACE-derived seawater mass signal has an annual amplitude of 32 ± 4. mm peaking in April. On inter-annual time scales, the mass-induced sea level variability is stronger than in the Mediterranean Sea, with an increase from 2003 to 2005 followed by a decrease from 2006 to 2008. Based on mass conservation, the mass-induced sea level variations, river runoff and precipitation minus evaporation are combined to derive the strait flows between the basins and with the Atlantic Ocean. At the Gibraltar strait, the net inflow varies annually with an amplitude of 52±10×10-3Sv peaking end of September (1Sv=106m3s-1). The inflow through the Bosphorus strait displays an annual amplitude of 13±3×10-3Sv peaking in the middle of March. Additionally, an increase of the Gibraltar net inflow (3.4±0.8×10-3Sv/yr) is detected. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Griesel, A</author><author>Mazloff, M R</author><author>Gille, S T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mean dynamic topography in the Southern Ocean: Evaluating Antarctic Circumpolar Current transport</title><secondary-title>J.

Combining sea level and geoid measurements, which are both attained primarily by satellite, is complicated by ocean variability and differences in resolved spatial scales. Accurate knowledge of the MDT is particularly difficult in the Southern Ocean as this region is characterized by high temporal variability, relatively short spatial scales, and a lack of in situ gravity observations. In this study, four recent Southern Ocean MDT products are evaluated along with an MDT diagnosed from a Southern Ocean state estimate. MDT products differ in some locations by more than the nominal error bars. Attempts to decrease this discrepancy by accounting for temporal differences in the time period each product represents were unsuccessful, likely due to issues regarding resolved spatial scales. The mean mass transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) system can be determined by combining the MDT products with climatological ocean density fields. On average, MDT products predict higher ACC transports than inferred from observations. More importantly, the MDT products imply an unrealistic lack of mass conservation that cannot be explained by the a priori uncertainties. MDT estimates can possibly be improved by accounting for an ocean mass balance constraint.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Sensitivity of the Drake Passage Transport to Air-Sea Momentum Flux</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>2279{\textendash}2290</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><isbn>0894-8755</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00030.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mazloff, M.

The geography of the large-scale, meridional quasigeostrophic potential vorticity (QGPV) gradient is mapped out using a climatological atlas, and attention is drawn to asymmetries between midlatitude eastward currents and subtropical return flows, the latter of which has westward and eastward zonal velocity shears. A linear stability analysis of the climatology, under the “local approximation,” yields the growth rates and scales of the fastest-growing modes. Fastest-growing modes on eastward-flowing currents, such as the Kuroshio and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, have a scale somewhat larger (by a factor of about 2) than Rdef. They are rapidly growing (e folding in 1–3 weeks) and deep reaching, and they can be characterized by an interaction between interior QGPV gradients, with a zero crossing in the QGPV gradient at depth. In contrast, fastest-growing modes in the subtropical return flows (as well as much of the gyre interiors) have a scale smaller than Rdef (by a factor of between 0.5 and 1), grow more slowly (e-folding scale of several weeks), and owe their existence to the interaction of a positive surface QGPV gradient and a negative gradient beneath.These predictions of linear theory under the local approximation are then compared to observed eddy length scales and spectral fluxes using altimetric data. It is found that the scale of observed eddies is some 2–3 times larger than the instability scale, indicative of a modest growth in horizontal scale. No evidence of an inverse cascade over decades in scale is found. Outside of a tropical band, the eddy scale varies with latitude along with but somewhat less strongly than Rdef.Finally, exactly the same series of calculations is carried out on fields from an idealized global eddying model, enabling study in a more controlled setting. Broadly similar conclusions are reached, thus reinforcing inferences made from the data.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zanna, Laure</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Moore, Andrew M</author><author>Tziperman, Eli</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimal Excitation of Interannual Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation Variability</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>413-427</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>Ocean dynamics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2010JCLI3610.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zanna, L., P.

The optimal three-dimensional spatial structure of temperature and salinity perturbations, defined as the leading singular vector and generating the maximum amplification of MOC anomalies, is evaluated by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem using tangent linear and adjoint models. Despite the stable linearized dynamics, a large amplification of MOC anomalies, mostly due to the interference of nonnormal modes, is initiated by the optimal perturbations. The largest amplification of MOC anomalies, found to be excited by high-latitude deep density perturbations in the northern part of the basin, is achieved after about 7.5 years. The anomalies grow as a result of a conversion of mean available potential energy into potential and kinetic energy of the perturbations, reminiscent of baroclinic instability. The time scale of growth of MOC anomalies can be understood by examining the time evolution of deep zonal density gradients, which are related to the MOC via the thermal wind relation. The velocity of propagation of the density anomalies, found to depend on the horizontal component of the mean flow velocity and the mean density gradient, determines the growth time scale of the MOC anomalies and therefore provides an upper bound on the MOC predictability time. The results suggest that the nonnormal linearized ocean dynamics can give rise to enhanced MOC variability if, for instance, overflows, eddies, and/or deep convection can excite high-latitude density anomalies in the ocean interior with a structure resembling that of the optimal perturbations found in this study. The findings also indicate that errors in ocean initial conditions or in model parameterizations or processes, particularly at depth, may significantly reduce the Atlantic MOC predictability time to less than a decade.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Gao, S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What governs the North Atlantic salinity maximum in a global GCM?</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><keywords><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>mixed-layer</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>sea-surface salinity</keyword><keyword>trends</keyword><keyword>tropical atlantic</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011gl046757</electronic-resource-num><notes>Qu, T.

Salinity budget terms were computed at the model's integration time step and archived as monthly averages. The simulated mixed layer salinity budget provides the first quantitative evidence for the ocean's role in governing the sea surface salinity maximum in the North Atlantic. Our analysis reveals that ocean dynamics explains about half of the sea surface salinity variance, being of equal importance as surface forcing. The sea surface salinity maximum varies both seasonally and interannually, as a consequence of interplay among surface flux, advection, and vertical entrainment. Contribution from eddies and small-scale processes is relatively weak but not negligible. These results may provide useful hints for the design and interpretation of future observations in the region. Citation: Qu, T., S. Gao, and I.

We investigated the causes of the Earth's Chandler wobble variability over the past 60 years. Our approach is based on integrating of the atmospheric and oceanic angular momentum computed by global circulation models. We directly compared the result of the integration with the Earth's pole coordinate observed by precise astrometric, space, and geodetic techniques. This approach differs from the traditional approach in which the observed polar motion is transformed into a so-called geodetic excitation function, and compared afterwards with the angular momentum of the external geophysical fluid layers. Methods. In the time domain, we integrated the atmospheric angular momentum time series from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis project and the oceanic angular momentum data from the ECCO consortium. We extracted the Chandler wobble from this modeled polar motion by singular spectrum analysis, and compared it with the Chandler wobble extracted from the observed polar motion given by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service data. Results. We showed that the combination of the atmosphere and the oceans explains most of the observed Chandler wobble variations, and is consistent with results reported in the literature and obtained with the traditional approach. Our approach allows one to appreciate the separate contributions of the atmosphere and the oceans to the various bumps and valleys observed in the Chandler wobble. Though the atmosphere explains the Chandler wobble amplitude variations between 1949 and 1970, the reexcitation of the Chandler wobble that begins in the 1980s, after a minimum around 1970, and that reaches its maximum in the late 1990s is due to the oceans, while the atmospheric contribution remains stable within the same period.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abernathey, Ryan</author><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Ferreira, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Dependence of Southern Ocean Meridional Overturning on Wind Stress</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2261-2278</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Southern Ocean,Baroclinic flows,Dynamics,Eddies,Ma</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-11-023.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Abernathey, R., J.

Marshall and T. Radko. In addition to wind and buoyancy forcing at the surface, the model contains a sponge layer at the northern boundary that permits a residual meridional overturning circulation (MOC) to exist at depth. The strength of the residual MOC is diagnosed for different strengths of surface wind stress. It is found that the eddy circulation largely compensates for the changes in Ekman circulation. The extent of the compensation and thus the sensitivity of the MOC to the winds depend on the surface boundary condition. A fixed-heat-flux surface boundary severely limits the ability of the MOC to change. An interactive heat flux leads to greater sensitivity. To explain the MOC sensitivity to the wind strength under the interactive heat flux, transformed Eulerian-mean theory is applied, in which the eddy diffusivity plays a central role in determining the eddy response. A scaling theory for the eddy diffusivity, based on the mechanical energy balance, is developed and tested; the average magnitude of the diffusivity is found to be proportional to the square root of the wind stress. The MOC sensitivity to the winds based on this scaling is compared with the true sensitivity diagnosed from the experiments.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rampal, P</author><author>Weiss, J</author><author>Dubois, C</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>IPCC climate models do not capture Arctic sea ice drift acceleration: Consequences in terms of projected sea ice thinning and decline</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C8</issue><keywords><keyword>0750 Sea ice</keyword><keyword>0762 Mass balance</keyword><keyword>0798 Modeling</keyword><keyword>1626 Global climate models</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>IPCC climate models</keyword><keyword>decline</keyword><keyword>kinematics</keyword><keyword>sea-ice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC007110</electronic-resource-num><notes>Rampal, P., J.

The recent Arctic sea ice decline is also characterized by a rapid thinning and by an increase of sea ice kinematics (velocities and deformation rates), with both processes being coupled through positive feedbacks. In this study we show that IPCC climate models underestimate the observed thinning trend by a factor of almost 4 on average and fail to capture the associated accelerated motion. The coupling between the ice state (thickness and concentration) and ice velocity is unexpectedly weak in most models. In particular, sea ice drifts faster during the months when it is thick and packed than when it is thin, contrary to what is observed; also models with larger long-term thinning trends do not show higher drift acceleration. This weak coupling behavior (1) suggests that the positive feedbacks mentioned above are underestimated and (2) can partly explain the models' underestimation of the recent sea ice area, thickness, and velocity trends. Due partly to this weak coupling, ice export does not play an important role in the simulated negative balance of Arctic sea ice mass between 1950 and 2050. If we assume a positive trend on ice speeds at straits equivalent to the one observed since 1979 within the Arctic basin, first-order estimations give shrinking and thinning trends that become significantly closer to the observations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, S D P</author><author>Penna, N T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Non-tidal ocean loading effects on geodetic GPS heights</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><keywords><keyword>deformation</keyword><keyword>earth</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>mass</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011gl046940</electronic-resource-num><notes>Williams, S.

Here we investigate NTOL effects on 3-4 year GPS height time series from 17 sites around the southern North Sea, and compute the NTOL displacement according to two ocean models; the global ECCO model and a high resolution regional model, POLSSM, which covers the northwest European continental shelf. To assess the susceptibility of GPS height estimates to NTOL, reprocessed GIPSY PPP daily solutions are corrected for the resulting displacement, together with atmospheric pressure loading (ATML). We find that the displacements due to NTOL are comparable in size to ATML and the combined correction reduces the variance by 12-22 mm2 (20-30% reduction in RMS). We find that POLSSM outperforms ECCO, with around an 11% greater variance reduction, and hence high resolution models are recommended to correct GPS heights for NTOL. Citation: Williams, S. D.

This study examines the seasonal-to-interannual variability of NPSTMW, the physical processes responsible for this variability, and the connections between NPSTMW and basin-scale climate signals using an eddy-permitting 1979–2006 ocean simulation made available by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2). The monthly mean seasonal cycle of NPSTMW in the simulation exhibits three distinct phases: (i) formation during November–March, (ii) isolation during March–June, and (iii) dissipation during June–November—each corresponding to significant changes in upper-ocean structure. An interannual signal is also evident in NPSTMW volume and other characteristic properties with volume minima occurring in 1979, 1988, and 1999. This volume variability is correlated with the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) with zero time lag. Further analyses demonstrate the connection of NPSTMW to the basin-scale ocean circulation. With this, modulations of upper-ocean structure driven by the varying strength and position of the westerlies as well as the regional air–sea heat flux pattern are seen to contribute to the variability of NPSTMW volume on interannual time scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, X</author><author>Collilieux, X</author><author>Altamimi, Z</author><author>Vermeersen, B L A</author><author>Gross, R S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accuracy of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame origin and Earth expansion</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>L13304</pages><volume>38</volume><keywords><keyword>deformation</keyword><keyword>glacial isostatic-adjustment</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011gl047450</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wu, X., X.

Accurately realizing and maintaining ITRF origin at the mean Earth system center of mass (CM) is critical to surface and spacecraft based geodetic measurements including those of sea level rise and its sources. Although ITRF combines data from satellite laser ranging (SLR), Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS), its origin is currently realized by the single technique of SLR. Consequently, it is difficult to independently evaluate the origin accuracy. Also, whether the solid Earth is expanding or shrinking has attracted persistent attention. The expansion rate, if any, has not been accurately determined before, due to insufficient data coverage on the Earth's surface and the presence of other geophysical processes. Here, we use multiple precise geodetic data sets and a simultaneous global estimation platform to determine that the ITRF2008 origin is consistent with the mean CM at the level of 0.5 mm yr(-1), and the mean radius of the Earth is not changing to within 1 sigma measurement uncertainty of 0.2 mm yr(-1).

The objective of this paper is to establish the relationship between these variations and atmospheric forcing over the subtropical North Atlantic. Based on satellite altimetry, hydrography, and atmospheric reanalysis products, it is demonstrated that the interannual variability of the Azores Current eastward velocity and eddy energy may be driven by the adjustment of the ocean to the strength of westerly and trade winds, modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation. Surface intensification (frontogenesis), which is mainly due to the wind-driven meridional Ekman current convergence, is found significant, but not sufficient to explain the observed interannual variability of the Azores Current strength.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, S</author><author>Qu, T D</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of mixing on the subduction of South Pacific waters identified by a simulated passive tracer and its adjoint</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>45-54</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>gcm</keyword><keyword>mixed-layer</keyword><keyword>mixing</keyword><keyword>mode waters</keyword><keyword>north-pacific</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>origin</keyword><keyword>pathway</keyword><keyword>south pacific</keyword><keyword>subduction</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>tracer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/J.Dynatmoce.2010.10.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gao, S., T.

Model simulations using a passive tracer and its adjoint are employed in conjunction with a particle tracking method to distinguish effects of mixing from those of advection. The results show that mixing processes can contribute to as much as 20% of the overall subduction rate in the South Pacific. Of this mixing contribution, about 30% can be attributed to meso-scale eddies, including their associated bolus transport, while the major part (70%) is due to other diabatic processes. The impact of mixing reaches its maximum near the Sub-Antarctic Front, accounting for nearly 30% of the total subduction rate. Consequently, estimates based on tracing particles or on advection alone may significantly underestimate the subduction rate in the South Pacific Ocean. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We assess how well we know such rapid, non-tidal p(b) signals by analyzing in-situ bottom pressure recorder (BPR) data and available global estimates from two very different modeling approaches. Estimated p(b) variance is generally lower than that measured by the BPRs, implying the presence of correlated model errors. Deriving uncertainties from differencing the model estimates can thus severely underestimate the aliasing errors. Removing estimated series from BPR data tends to reduce the variance by up to similar to 5 cm(2) but residual variance is still similar to 5-20 cm(2) and not negligible relative to expected variance in climate p(b) signals. The residual p(b) variability can be correlated over hundreds of kilometers. Results indicate the need to improve estimates of rapid p(b) variability in order to minimize aliasing noise in current and future satellite-based p(b) observations. Citation: Quinn, K. J., and R. M.

A Lagrangian method based on the Okubo–Weiss parameter is used to identify the structures and track their main characteristics. Between 8°S and 8°N, the structure characteristics are spatially inhomogeneous compared to higher latitudes. They can be grouped into three categories: anticyclonic and cyclonic structures off the equator and the equatorial structures between 2°S and 2°N. They all have a strong annual cycle with maximum presence from September to March, except during strong El Niño years, when the number of structures becomes very low. Off the equator from 2° to 8°, the anticyclonic structures dominate, but with drastically different characteristics north and south of the equator. In the north, large nonlinear vortices develop (known as the tropical instability vortices) in phase with the 30–35-day oscillation related to an unstable first-meridional-mode Rossby waves. In the south, mostly fragmentary linear structures are present, with lower propagation speeds. The equatorial structures are mostly counterclockwise. The larger ones tend to be linear and are clearly associated with Yanai waves. The large majority of the cyclonic structures off the equator are also quite linear and smaller and less numerous than the anticyclonic structures. However, some of them are nonlinear with vorticity values higher than 2 times the Coriolis parameter.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Downes, S M</author><author>Gnanadesikan, A</author><author>Griffies, S M</author><author>Sarmiento, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water Mass Exchange in the Southern Ocean in Coupled Climate Models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1756-1771</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>air-sea fluxes</keyword><keyword>deacon cell</keyword><keyword>flow patterns</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>ice</keyword><keyword>overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>simulation</keyword><keyword>total geostrophic circulation</keyword><keyword>transformation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2011jpo4586.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Downes, S.

The meridional transport of deep and intermediate waters across 30 degrees S agrees well between models and observationally based estimates in the Atlantic Ocean but not in the Indian and Pacific, where the model-based estimates are much smaller. Associated with this, in the models about half the southward-flowing deep water is converted into lighter waters and half is converted to denser bottom waters, whereas the observationally based estimates convert most of the inflowing deep water to bottom waters. In the models, both Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) are formed primarily via an interior diapycnal transformation rather than being transformed at the surface via heat or freshwater fluxes. Given the small vertical diffusivity specified in the models in this region, the authors conclude that other processes such as cabbeling and thermobaricity must be playing an important role in water mass transformation. Finally, in the models, the largest contribution of the surface buoyancy fluxes in the Southern Ocean is to convert Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) and AAIW into lighter Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW).</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manizza, M</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>McClelland, J W</author><author>Hill, C N</author><author>Peterson, B J</author><author>Key, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A model of the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>0428 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>0793 Biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4820 Gases</keyword><keyword>air-sea gas exchange</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>land-ocean coupling</keyword><keyword>numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>ocean carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>polar oceans</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC006998</electronic-resource-num><notes>Manizza, M., Follows, M.

The model qualitatively captures the observed regional and seasonal trends in surface ocean PO4, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and pCO2. Integrated annually, over the basin, the model suggests a net annual uptake of 59 Tg C a−1, within the range of published estimates based on the extrapolation of local observations (20–199 Tg C a−1). This flux is attributable to the cooling (increasing solubility) of waters moving into the basin, mainly from the subpolar North Atlantic. The air-sea flux is regulated seasonally and regionally by sea-ice cover, which modulates both air-sea gas transfer and the photosynthetic production of organic matter, and by the delivery of riverine dissolved organic carbon (RDOC), which drive the regional contrasts in pCO2 between Eurasian and North American coastal waters. Integrated over the basin, the delivery and remineralization of RDOC reduces the net oceanic CO2 uptake by ∼10%.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holloway, Greg</author><author>Nguyen, An</author><author>Wang, Zeliang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceans and ocean models as seen by current meters</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C8</issue><keywords><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>observing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC007044</electronic-resource-num><notes>Holloway, G., Nguyen, A., &amp;amp; Wang, Z.

We affirm previous indications of strongly positive topostrophy toward higher latitudes, and we consider variation with depth. We explore use of the current meter data set for evaluating models skills. This is illustrated from two models applied to Arctic Ocean circulation: (1) examining the influence of successive grid refinement in a high-resolution eddy-active model and (2) assessing skill in a coarse-resolution noneddying model for which effects of unresolved eddies are parameterized. We see that finer-grid eddy-active models achieve higher topostrophy and improved skill. We find that a coarse-grid noneddying model can be improved by parameterization.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Condron, Alan</author><author>Winsor, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A subtropical fate awaited freshwater discharged from glacial Lake Agassiz</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>1605 Abrupt/rapid climate change</keyword><keyword>3344 Paleoclimatology</keyword><keyword>4528 Fronts and jets</keyword><keyword>4962 Thermohaline</keyword><keyword>5462 Polar regions</keyword><keyword>8.2-kyr-event</keyword><keyword>abrupt climate change</keyword><keyword>buoyant flow</keyword><keyword>freshwater</keyword><keyword>meltwater</keyword><keyword>paleoclimate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010GL046011</electronic-resource-num><notes>Condron, A., &amp;amp; Winsor, P.

Using a high-resolution (1/6°) global, ocean-ice circulation model we present an alternative view that freshwater discharged from glacial Lake Agassiz would have remained on the continental shelf as a narrow, buoyant, coastal current, and would have been transported south into the subtropical North Atlantic. The pathway we describe is in contrast to the conceptual idea that freshwater from this lake outburst spread over most of the sub-polar North Atlantic, and covered the deep, open-ocean, convection regions. This coastally confined freshwater pathway is consistent with the present-day routing of freshwater from Hudson Bay, as well as paleoceanographic evidence of this event. Using a coarse-resolution (2.6°) version of the same model, we demonstrate that the previously reported spreading of freshwater across the sub-polar North Atlantic results from the inability of numerical models of this resolution to accurately resolve narrow coastal flows, producing instead a diffuse circulation that advects freshwater away from the boundaries. To understand the climatic impact of freshwater released in the past or future (e.g. Greenland and Antarctica), the ocean needs to be modeled at a resolution sufficient to resolve the dynamics of narrow, coastal buoyant flows.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halkides, D</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Kida, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms controlling the seasonal mixed-layer temperature and salinity of the Indonesian seas</title><secondary-title>Ocean Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>481-495</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>Indonesian seas</keyword><keyword>Mixed layer</keyword><keyword>Ocean-state estimation</keyword><keyword>Seasonal heat budget</keyword><keyword>Seasonal salinity</keyword><keyword>budget</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>gcm</keyword><keyword>maritime continent</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>parameterization</keyword><keyword>region</keyword><keyword>sensitivity</keyword><keyword>throughflow</keyword><keyword>upper ocean</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10236-010-0374-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>Halkides, D., T.

MLT in these seas is relatively high during November-May (austral spring through fall) and relatively low during June-September (austral winter and the period associated with the Asian summer monsoon). Surface heat flux makes the largest contribution to the seasonal MLT tendency, with significant reinforcement by subsurface processes, especially turbulent vertical mixing. Temperature declines (the MLT tendency is negative) in May-August when seasonal insolation is smallest and local winds are strong due to the southeast monsoon, which causes surface heat loss and cooling by vertical processes. In particular, Ekman suction induced by local wind stress curl raises the thermocline in the Arafura Sea, bringing cooler subsurface water closer to the base of the mixed layer where it is subsequently incorporated into the mixed layer through turbulent vertical mixing; this has a cooling effect. The MLT budget also has a small, but non-negligible, semi-annual component since insolation increases and winds weaken during the spring and fall monsoon transitions near the equator. This causes warming via solar heating, reduced surface heat loss, and weakened turbulent mixing compared to austral winter and, to a lesser extent, compared to austral summer. Seasonal MLS is dominated by ocean processes rather than by local freshwater flux. The contributions by horizontal advection and subsurface processes have comparable magnitudes. The results suggest that ocean dynamics play a significant part in determining both seasonal MLT and MLS in the region, such that coupled model studies of the region should use a full ocean model rather than a slab ocean mixed-layer model.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Maze, Guillaume</author><author>Buckley, Martha</author><author>Marshall, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated Seasonal Cycle of North Atlantic Eighteen Degree Water Volume</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>269-286</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Seasonal cycle,North Atlantic,Water masses,Airndas</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2010JPO4257.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Forget, G., G.

The EDW layer is defined as all waters that have a temperature between 17° and 19°C. The study is facilitated by a synthesis of various observations—principally Argo profiles of temperature and salinity, sea surface temperature, and altimetry—using a general circulation model as an interpolation tool. The winter increase in EDW volume is most pronounced in February, peaking at about 8.6 Svy, where 1 Svy ≈ 3.15 × 1013 m3 corresponding to a 1 Sv (Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1) flow sustained for one year. This largely reflects winter EDW formation due to air–sea heat fluxes. Over the remainder of the year, newly created EDW is consumed by air–sea heat fluxes and ocean mixing, which roughly contribute ⅔ and ⅓, respectively. The authors estimate a net annual volume increase of 1.4 Svy, averaged over the 3-yr period. It is small compared to the amplitude of the seasonal cycle (8.6 Svy) and annual formation due to air–sea fluxes (4.6 Svy). The overall EDW layer volume thus appears to fluctuate around a stable point during the study period. An estimate of the full EDW volume budget is provided along with an uncertainty estimate of 1.8 Svy, and largely resolves apparent conflicts between previous estimates.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, S G</author><author>Zhang, L J</author><author>Tapley, B D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The understanding of length-of-day variations from satellite gravity and laser ranging measurements</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><pages>651-660</pages><volume>184</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Earth</keyword><keyword>Satellite geodesy</keyword><keyword>Time series analysis</keyword><keyword>Time variable gravity</keyword><keyword>atmospheric angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>earths</keyword><keyword>field</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>lageos</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean tides</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>rotation</keyword><keyword>rotation variations</keyword><keyword>seasonal-variations</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04869.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Jin, S.

Numerous studies on the LOD excitations have been made from climatological/hydrological assimilation systems and models of the general circulation of the ocean. However, quantitative assessment and understanding of the contributions to the LOD remain unclear due mainly to the lack of direct global observations. In this paper, the total Earth's surface fluids mass excitations to the LOD at seasonal and intraseasonal timescales are investigated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Estimating Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-analysis (ERA)-Interim, GRACE-derived surface fluids mass and the spherical harmonics coefficient C-20 from the satellite laser ranging (SLR) as well as combined GRACE+SLR solutions, respectively. Results show that the GRACE and the combined GRACE and SLR solutions better explain the geodetic residual LOD excitations at annual and semi-annual timescales. For less than 1 yr timescales, GRACE-derived mass is worse to explain the geodetic residuals, whereas SLR agrees better with the geodetic residuals. However, the combined GRACE and SLR results are much improved in explaining the geodetic residual excitations at intraseasonal scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, An T</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Kwok, Ronald</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Arctic ice-ocean simulation with optimized model parameters: Approach and assessment</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C4</issue><keywords><keyword>1910 Data assimilation</keyword><keyword>1952 Modeling</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4283 Water masses</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>data</keyword><keyword>integration and fusion</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>optimization</keyword><keyword>sea ice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010JC006573</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nguyen, A.

A Green's function approach adjusts a set of parameters for best model-data agreement. Overall, model-data differences are reduced by 45%. The optimized simulation reproduces the negative trends in ice extent in the satellite records. Volume and thickness distributions are comparable to those from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (2003–2008). The upper cold halocline is consistent with observations in the western Arctic. The freshwater budget of the Arctic Ocean and volume/heat transports of Pacific and Atlantic waters across major passages are comparable with observation-based estimates. We note that the optimized parameters depend on the selected atmospheric forcing. The use of the 25 year Japanese reanalysis results in sea ice albedos that are consistent with field observations. Simulated Pacific Water enters the Bering Strait and flows off the Chukchi Shelf along four distinct channels. This water takes ∼5–10 years to exit the Arctic Ocean at the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Nares, or Fram straits. Atlantic Water entering the Fram Strait flows eastward, merges with the St Ana Trough inflow, and splits into two branches at the southwest corner of the Makarov Basin. One branch flows along Lomonosov Ridge back to Fram Strait. The other enters the western Arctic, circulates cyclonically below the halocline, and exits mainly through the Nares and Fram straits. This work utilizes the record of available observations to obtain an Arctic Ocean simulation that is in agreement with observations both within and beyond the optimization period and that can be used for tracer and process studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spreen, Gunnar</author><author>Kwok, Ron</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trends in Arctic sea ice drift and role of wind forcing: 1992–2009</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>0750 Sea ice</keyword><keyword>0758 Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>1621 Cryospheric change</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>drift</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword><keyword>sea ice</keyword><keyword>trends</keyword><keyword>wind</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GL048970</electronic-resource-num><notes>Spreen, G., R.

Between 1992 and 2009, the spatially averaged trend in drift speed within the Arctic Basin is 10.6% ± 0.9%/decade, and ranges between −4% and 16%/decade depending on the location. The mean trend is dominated by the second half of the period. In fact, for the five years after a clear break point in March 2004, the average trend increased to 46% ± 5%/decade. Over the 1992–2009 period, averaged trends of wind speed from four atmospheric reanalyses are only 1% to 2%/decade. Regionally, positive trends in wind speed (of up to 9%/decade) are seen over a large fraction of the Central Arctic, where the trends in drift speeds are highest. Spatial correlations between the basin-wide trends in wind and drift speeds are moderate (between 0.40 and 0.52). Our results suggest that changes in wind speed explain a fraction of the observed increase in drift speeds in the Central Arctic but not over the entire basin. In other regions thinning of the ice cover is a more likely cause of the increase in ice drift speed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piecuch, C G</author><author>Ponte, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of interannual steric sea level variability</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>4568 Turbulence</keyword><keyword>and mixing processes</keyword><keyword>closed property budgets</keyword><keyword>diffusion</keyword><keyword>ocean dynamics</keyword><keyword>sea level variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GL048440</electronic-resource-num><notes>Piecuch, C.

The estimate's dynamical consistency allows for the comprehensive attribution of steric changes in terms of advection, diffusion, and surface buoyancy exchange processes. Steric variations are found to be owing more to oceanic transports than to local surface buoyancy fluxes. Advection is responsible for steric variability in the tropical Indian and Pacific oceans. At extratropical latitudes, advection and diffusion appear to be equally important. Local surface buoyancy fluxes can contribute in some regions (e.g., the tropical Atlantic). Analysis of the anomalous wind stress curl shows that extra-equatorial vertical advection is driven primarily by Ekman pumping. The complexity of the interannual steric budget suggests that anomalous sea level is probably not predictable on the basis of ocean memory alone. Furthermore, proper parameterizations of mixing processes and good estimates of wind-driven transports both appear to be very important to reliable projections of interannual sea level.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Monteiro, F M</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biogeographical controls on the marine nitrogen fixers</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>25</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>0469 Nitrogen cycling</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4815 Ecosystems</keyword><keyword>4855 Phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>and modeling</keyword><keyword>biogeography</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>iron cycle</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>nitrogen fixers</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword><keyword>resource competition theory</keyword><keyword>structure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010GB003902</electronic-resource-num><notes>Monteiro, F.

As is observed, the model's total diazotroph population is distributed over most of the oligotrophic warm subtropical and tropical waters, with the exception of the southeastern Pacific Ocean. This biogeography broadly follows temperature and light constraints which are often used in both field-based and model studies to explain the distribution of diazotrophs. However, the model suggests that diazotroph habitat is not directly controlled by temperature and light, but is restricted to the ocean regions with low fixed nitrogen and sufficient dissolved iron and phosphate concentrations. We interpret this regulation by iron and phosphate using resource competition theory which provides an excellent qualitative and quantitative framework.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Forget, Gael</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Utke, Jean</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Timescales and regions of the sensitivity of Atlantic meridional volume and heat transport: Toward observing system design</title><secondary-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1858-1879</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>17-18</issue><keywords><keyword>Adjoint sensitivities</keyword><keyword>Decadal variability</keyword><keyword>Dual state space</keyword><keyword>Meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>Observing system design</keyword><keyword>Oceanic teleconnections</keyword><keyword>Poleward heat transport</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dsr2.2010.10.065</electronic-resource-num><notes>Heimbach, P., C.

Focus is on the effect of temperature (and salinity) perturbations. On short timescales (months), as expected, the greatest sensitivities are to local disturbances, but as the timescales extend back to a decade and longer, the region of influence expands to occupy much of the Atlantic basin and significant areas of the global ocean, although the influence of any specific point or small area tends to be quite weak. The propagation of information in the dual solution is a clear manifestation of oceanic teleconnections. It takes place through identifiable “dual” Kelvin, Rossby, and continental shelf-waves with an interpretable physics, in particular in terms of dual expressions of barotropic and baroclinic adjustment processes. Among the notable features are the relatively fast timescales of influence (albeit weak in amplitude) between 26°N and the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean, the absence of dominance of the sub-polar North Atlantic, significant connections to the Agulhas leakage region in the southeast Atlantic on timescales of 5–10 years, and the marked sensitivity propagation of Doppler-shifted Rossby waves in the Southern Ocean on timescales of a decade and beyond. Regional, as well as time-dependent, differences between MVT and MHT sensitivities highlight the lack of a simple correspondence between their variability. Some implications for observing systems for the purpose of climate science are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Jones, Helen</author><author>Marshall, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Super-parameterization in ocean modeling: Application to deep convection</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>90-101</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Deep convection</keyword><keyword>Multi-scale modeling</keyword><keyword>Ocean modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2010.10.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Campin, J.-M., C.

The distribution of argon and neon is simulated using the time-varying, three-dimensional circulation fields determined by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Oceans (ECCO) project from 1992 to 2008. The model is in overall agreement with limited observational data from the subpolar and subtropical North Pacific using a relatively low vertical diffusivity. Temporal variability in argon saturation is enhanced in the surface ocean, dominated by diffusive gas exchange coupled to air-sea heat fluxes. This variability in surface argon saturation is significantly correlated to the Southern Oscillation Index (El Nino) in the tropics and to the North Pacific Index in midlatitudes. Using sensitivity experiments, we find that the mean state of argon saturation in the ventilated thermocline is characterized by a mutual compensation between mixing-induced supersaturation and sea level pressure and heat-flux-induced undersaturation. Neon distributions exhibit a stronger influence from bubble-mediated gas fluxes that is partially compensated by the effect of sea level pressure variation. Our result demonstrates the important role of air-sea interaction and ocean mixing in controlling the mean state of the dissolved noble gases and highlights the importance of diffusive gas exchange coupled to air-sea heat fluxes in controlling temporal variability, with implications for using noble gas measurements to derive estimates of diapycnal diffusivity in the subtropical thermocline.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ubelmann, Clement</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cyclonic eddies formed at the Pacific tropical instability wave fronts</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>116</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>4283 Water masses</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4528 Fronts and jets</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>TIW</keyword><keyword>eddy</keyword><keyword>front</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC007204</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ubelmann, C., and L.-L.

They have highly coherent structures below the surface, carrying cold and salty upwelled equatorial water probably rich in marine life.

Here we use global and targeted proteomic analyses on a key unicellular marine diazotroph Crocosphaera watsonii to reveal large scale diel changes in its proteome, including substantial variations in concentrations of iron metalloproteins involved in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, as well as nocturnal flavodoxin production. The daily synthesis and degradation of enzymes in coordination with their utilization results in a lowered cellular metalloenzyme inventory that requires ∼40% less iron than if these enzymes were maintained throughout the diel cycle. This strategy is energetically expensive, but appears to serve as an important adaptation for confronting the iron scarcity of the open oceans. A global numerical model of ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and ecosystems suggests that Crocosphaera’s ability to reduce its iron-metalloenzyme inventory provides two advantages: It allows Crocosphaera to inhabit regions lower in iron and allows the same iron supply to support higher Crocosphaera biomass and nitrogen fixation than if they did not have this reduced iron requirement.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling Diverse Communities of Marine Microbes</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Marine Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Marine Science</full-title></periodical><pages>427-451</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>community structure</keyword><keyword>microbes</keyword><keyword>phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>traits</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21329212</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142848</electronic-resource-num><notes>Follows, M.

Over the past decade, marine ecosystem and biogeochemistry models have begun to address some of this diversity by resolving several groups of (mostly autotrophic) plankton, differentiated by biogeochemical function. Here, we review recent model approaches that are rooted in the notion that an even richer diversity is fundamental to the organization of marine microbial communities. These models begin to resolve, and address the significance of, diversity within functional groups. Seeded with diverse populations spanning prescribed regions of trait space, these simulations self-select community structure according to relative fitness in the virtual environment. Such models are suited to considering ecological questions, such as the regulation of patterns of biodiversity, and to simulating the response to changing environments. A key issue for all such models is the constraint of viable trait space and trade-offs. Size-structuring and mechanistic descriptions of energy and resource allocation at the individual level can rationalize these constraints.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roquet, Fabien</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Madec, Gurvan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Patterns of Wind-Power Input to the Ocean Circulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2328-2342</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Ekman pumping/transport,Energy transport,Ocean cir</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-11-024.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Roquet, F., C.

Direct rates of wind work can be calculated through the wind stress acting on the surface geostrophic flow. However, because that energy is transported laterally in the Ekman layer, the injection into the geostrophic interior is actually controlled by Ekman pumping, with a pattern determined by the wind curl rather than the wind itself. Regions of power injection into the geostrophic interior are thus generally shifted poleward compared to regions of direct wind-power input, most notably in the Southern Ocean, where on average energy enters the interior 10° south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current core. An interpretation of the wind-power input to the interior is proposed, expressed as a downward flux of pressure work. This energy flux is a measure of the work done by the Ekman pumping against the surface elevation pressure, helping to maintain the observed anomaly of sea surface height relative to the global-mean sea level.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gennerich, Hans-Hermann</author><author>Villinger, Heinrich</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deciphering the ocean bottom pressure variation in the Logatchev hydrothermal field at the eastern flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge</title><secondary-title>Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>1209 Tectonic deformation</keyword><keyword>3017 Hydrothermal systems</keyword><keyword>3075 Submarine tectonics and volcanism</keyword><keyword>Logatchev hydrothermal field</keyword><keyword>Mid-Atlantic Ridge</keyword><keyword>gravity waves</keyword><keyword>ocean bottom pressure</keyword><keyword>seafloor deformation</keyword><keyword>surface waves</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010GC003441</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gennerich, H.-H., &amp;amp; Villinger, H.

The data were collected with two ocean bottom pressure meters (OBPs), constructed at the University of Bremen, that are capable of recording signals with frequencies up to 0.25 Hz. Over the long-term, a nearly 2.5 kPa (25 cm water column equivalent) pressure variation over 3.7 years is observed, which is consistent with uplift followed by subsidence, but cannot unequivocally be discerned from instrumental drift. Medium-term pressure variations are compared with satellite surface topography, satellite gravity, ocean modeling, and in situ data from an OBP 700 km away. It is shown that fluctuations in the oceanic mass distribution dominate the variations in this frequency range and that oceanic modeling and data from a 700 km distant OBP are positively correlated with the LHF bottom pressure time series. The short-term variations are dominated by microseisms originating from sea surface waves and pressure waves from earthquakes as can be shown by comparison with weather buoy and teleseismic data.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Driving ecosystem and biogeochemical models with optimal state estimates of the ocean circulation</title><secondary-title>CLIVAR Exchanges</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CLIVAR Exchanges</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><notes>Dutkiewicz, S.

Near the edge of the core regions of high eddy energy, agreement is observed with the prediction of the surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) turbulence theory, which has fundamental differences from that of the traditional quasigeostrophic (QG) turbulence theory. In the core regions of high eddy energy, the spectra are consistent with frontogenesis that is not fully accounted for by the SQG theory. However, the observations in the vast ocean interior of low eddy energy exhibit substantial differences from the predictions of existing theories of oceanic mesoscale turbulence. The spectra in these regions may reflect the ocean’s response to short-scale atmospheric forcing and air–sea interaction. The observations presented in this paper serve as a test bed for new theories and ocean general circulation models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Yongsheng</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author><author>Tulloch, Ross R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Global Characteristics of the Wavenumber Spectrum of Ocean Surface Wind</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1576-1582</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-11-059.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Xu, Y., L.-L.

Here the authors performed a spectral analysis of QuikSCAT winds over the global ocean and found that (i) the spectral slopes become steeper toward the Poles in the Pacific and in the South Atlantic, and the slopes exhibit minimal longitudinal dependence in the South Pacific; (ii) the steepest slopes are in the tropical Indian Ocean and the shallowest slopes are in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic; and (iii) the spectra are steeper in winter than summer in most regions of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere. The new findings reported in the paper provide a test bed for theoretical studies and atmospheric general circulation models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Todd, Robert E.</author><author>Rudnick, Daniel L.</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R.</author><author>Davis, Russ E.</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Poleward flows in the southern California Current System: Glider observations and numerical simulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>C02026</pages><volume>116</volume><issue>C2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010JC006536</electronic-resource-num><notes>Todd, R.

Previous modeling studies with coarse resolution models show varying estimates of carbon uptake there due to the differences in the representation of physical circulation and mesoscale processes. We develop a new eddy-permitting carbon cycle model of the Southern Ocean with improved representation of eddies, jets, and frontal structures. The model employs physical circulation fields from a Southern Ocean State Estimate: a model solution that is constrained by a suite of remotely sensed and in situ measurements to ensure realistic hydrographic structures and transport fields. A simple biogeochemistry model is coupled to the physical model to simulate the cycling of alkalinity, carbon, and nutrients. In this paper we compare simulated biogeochemical tracers with observations, and diagnose mechanisms controlling the regional carbon cycle. Model-data comparisons in Drake Passage and CLIVAR repeat sections provide tests for the model performance in capturing observed biogeochemical properties. Temporal variability of air-sea CO2flux is primarily controlled by surface pCO2on seasonal timescale, modulated by rapid fluctuations in surface wind speed on a shorter timescale. Analysis of simulated carbon transport indicates that the zonal mean circulation transports carbon southward, partly compensated by the northward stationary and transient eddy fluxes. Variability of zonal mean circulation, which is strongly correlated with Ekman transport, dominates the temporal variability of meridional carbon transport across the Polar Front. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kinney, Jaclyn Clement</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Bering Sea : communication with the Western subarctic gyre, mesoscale activity, shelf-basin exchange, and the flow through Bering Strait</title></titles><periodical/><pages>142</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><notes>Kinney, J.

Understanding the physical oceanography of the Bering Sea is significant for the U.S. Navy due to the expected increase in ship traffic and exploration of natural resources that will likely coincide with the ongoing retreat of sea ice in the Western Arctic. This model represents a large step forward in the ability to simulate the mesoscale eddies and meanders in the Alaskan Stream and the deep Bering Sea basin, which are shown to exert a strong control on the flow into and out of the western Aleutian Island passes. Model results show that upwelling of deep Bering Sea water, which is the primary source of nutrients for important ecosystems of the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas, is enhanced by the presence of cyclonic eddies in the vicinity of canyons along the slope. High values of eddy kinetic energy in Bering and Anadyr straits help explain the areas of high biological productivity located just downstream in the Chirikov Basin and north of Bering Strait. Model results show significant horizontal and vertical shear in the flow through Bering Strait, and indicate a need for more observations of the flow structure on a continuous basis.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dorman, Jeffrey G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Influence of Seasonal and Decadal Trends in Coastal Ocean Processes on the Population Biology of the krill species Euphausia pacifica: Results of a coupled ecosystem and individual based modeling study</title></titles><periodical/><pages>98</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><notes>Dorman, J.

Understanding the short time scale (weeks to seasonal) and long time scale (decadal) variability in abundance, condition, and spatial patterns that results from changes in ocean conditions is critical if we hope to manage the fishery of any higher trophic levels from more than a single species approach. I have coupled a suite of models in an attempt to understand the impacts of changing ocean conditions on this important prey item. The coastal ocean was simulated with a commonly used oceanographic model (Regional Ocean Modeling System) coupled with an ecosystem model (Nutrient, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Detritus). The coastal ocean was simulated from Newport, OR to Point Conception, CA over an 18-year period (1991 – 2008). These model results were used to force a 3-dimensional individual based model (IBM) that was parameterized to represent the krill species Euphausia pacifica. Biological processes of the IBM (growth, life-stage progression, mortality, reproduction, vertical migration) were compared to laboratory data and field data under varying food and temperature conditions to understand how well the model can reproduced known biological rates and processes. The model performs well at simulating growth, life stage progression, and reproduction, as these are the areas from which there is an abundance of data from which to parameterize the model. Results from simulations of larval and adult populations indicated the greatest amount growth in both larval and adult populations was over the six- month period from April through October. Mortality was greatest for larvae during the winter (when food resources are typically lowest), but mortality was greatest for adults during summer due to offshore transport of individuals to regions of warmer surface waters and reduced food concentration. Condition of individuals and mortality of individuals correlated positively with the more productive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the North Pacific Decadal Oscillation, providing evidence the impact of ocean basin scale atmospheric conditions on krill. The impacts of atmospheric forcing on E. pacifica are important factors that control the distribution, abundance and productivity of this important prey item for many commercially important fisheries of the West Coast of the United States.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>DeVries, Tim</author><author>Primeau, François</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamically and Observationally Constrained Estimates of Water-Mass Distributions and Ages in the Global Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2381-2401</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO-D-10-05011.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>DeVries, T., &amp;amp; Primeau, F.

Numerical simulation of Arctic sea ice. The results show that this model can well simulate the Arctic sea ice season and interannual variation observed by satellite, and has a good numerical simulation ability of Arctic sea ice. Based on this, four sets of post-test studies were conducted on the two cases of Arctic sea ice ablation and growth in July and October 2009. The NCEP reanalyzed the climatic field and NCEPGFS (Global Forecast System) forecast data as atmospheric forcing fields, and adopted two different SSM/I (dedicated microwave imager) sea ice concentration initialization schemes. The comparison of forecast results with SSM/I, as well as forecasting skill analysis, shows that this model has short-term forecasting capabilities for Arctic sea ice. The difference in atmospheric forcing field is not significant for the improvement of sea ice forecasting, and the prediction of SSM/I sea ice concentration to reduce the initial error can better simulate the melting and growth of sea ice. In addition, the sea ice concentration of the model simulation is slightly higher, and the simulation ability of the sea ice freezing process is better than the ablation process.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hemery, LG</author><author>Galton-Fenzi, B</author><author>Améziane, N</author><author>Riddle, MJ</author><author>Rintoul, SR</author><author>Beaman, RJ</author><author>Post, AL</author><author>Eléaume, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting habitat preferences for Anthometrina adriani (Echinodermata) on the East Antarctic continental shelf</title><secondary-title>Marine Ecology Progress Series</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine Ecology Progress Series</full-title></periodical><pages>105-116</pages><volume>441</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3354/meps09330</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hemery, L., Galton-Fenzi, B., Améziane, N., Riddle, M., Rintoul, S., Beaman, R., … Eléaume, M.

We consider the climatically important transports of volume, heat, and freshwater through Fram Strait. A coarse grid (nominally 1°) global ocean model is seen to underrepresent exchanges. We test effects of eddy stress (Neptune) parameterization, finding strengthened volume exchanges both to and from the Arctic and increased mean northward heat transport while limiting southward freshwater export. Results are closer to observed transports and to results from fine-resolution models.

At present, the models are IAU2006 and IAU 2000, respectively. The celestial pole offsets are regularly measured by Very Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), the observations being coordinated and published by the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS). These offsets contain a mixture of several effects: the unpredictable free term, Free Core Nutation (FCN) that is due to the presence of the outer fluid core of the Earth, forced motions excited by the motions in the atmosphere and oceans, and also imperfections of the adopted precession-nutation models. The geophysical excitations are also available, as determined by several atmospheric and oceanographic services. The aim of this paper is to compare the time series of these integrated excitations with the observed celestial pole offsets and estimate the level of coherence between them.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Sebille, Erik</author><author>Baringer, Molly O.</author><author>Johns, William E.</author><author>Meinen, Christopher S.</author><author>Beal, Lisa M.</author><author>de Jong, M.

Such mass redistribution produced by SAL effects is shown to be an important component of OBP variability on scales from months to years and to provide for a better description of the OBP annual cycle observed by GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment). The SAL‐induced ocean mass variations have magnitudes comparable to the dynamic OBP signals at subannual, annual, and interannual time scales in many ocean regions and should not be ignored in studies of ocean mass. Annual variations account for the most variability in SAL‐related mass signals and can be induced by all the loads considered, with hydrology having the largest contribution. At subannual and interannual time scales, impact of hydrology is minimal and variations are mostly related to load changes from ocean dynamics and from changes in atmospheric circulation, depending on ocean region. The results demonstrate that the large‐scale SAL effects are not negligible in the analysis of GRACE‐derived global observations of OBP. The estimated SAL effects can explain on average 0.2 cm2 (16%) of the variance in the GRACE annual cycle (expressed in terms of equivalent water height), exceeding 1 cm2 in both open ocean and coastal regions with strong annual SAL signals.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halkides, Daria</author><author>Lee, Tong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms controlling seasonal mixed layer temperature and salinity in the Southwestern Tropical Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>77-93</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Indian Ocean</keyword><keyword>Mixed layer budgets</keyword><keyword>Thermocline ridge</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><isbn>0377-0265</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2011.03.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Halkides, D., &amp;amp; Lee, T.

For seasonal MLT, surface heat flux and ocean processes are both important. They tend to re-enforce each other during peak cooling (May-June) and warming (November) periods, but not during transition periods. The dominant ocean process is wind-driven vertical mixing. It is modulated by the variable strength of the monsoon winds (which affect the vertical diffusivity), and to a lesser extent by variability of thermocline depth (which influences the vertical stratification across the ML base). For example, thermocline shoaling in April-July alters the vertical stratification near the ML base; thus, when the monsoon winds heighten (June-September) and the vertical diffusivity increases (deepening the ML base), relatively cool subsurface water is near the ML base and easily incorporated into the ML by vertical mixing. However, vertical advection as a direct response to thermocline shoaling has little affect on MLT. This explains why MLT and thermocline depth are not positively correlated here on the seasonal timescale (as they are on the interannual timescale). Meridional advection associated with Ekman transport driven by the monsoon winds plays a secondary role. Seasonal MLS, however, is dominated by meridional advection. Vertical process effects on MLS are small, due to a weak salinity gradient near the ML base throughout the year. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nastula, Jolanta</author><author>Paśnicka, Małgorzata</author><author>Kołaczek, Barbara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of the geophysical excitations of polar motion from the period: 1980.0–2009.0</title><secondary-title>Acta Geophysica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Geophysica</full-title></periodical><pages>561-577</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2478/s11600-011-0008-2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nastula, J., Paśnicka, M., &amp;amp; Kołaczek, B.

Effects of atmospheric fields (especially wind stress) and ocean state on the eastern equatorial Pacific SST variations are investigated using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) and its adjoint model, which can calculate the sensitivities of a cost function (in this case the averaged 0–30-m temperature in the Niño-3 region during an ENSO event peak) to previous atmospheric forcing fields and ocean state going backward in time. The sensitivity of the Niño-3 surface temperature to monthly zonal wind stress in preceding months can be understood by invoking mixed layer heat balance, ocean dynamics, and especially linear equatorial wave dynamics. The maximum positive sensitivity of the Niño-3 surface temperature to local wind forcing usually happens ~1–2 months before the peak of the ENSO event and is hypothesized to be associated with the Ekman pumping mechanism. In model experiments, its magnitude is closely related to the subsurface vertical temperature gradient, exhibiting strong event-to-event differences with strong (weak) positive sensitivity during La Niña (strong El Niño) events. The adjoint sensitivity to remote wind forcing in the central and western equatorial Pacific is consistent with the standard hypothesis that the remote wind forcing affects the Niño-3 surface temperature indirectly by exciting equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves and modulating thermocline depth in the Niño-3 region. The current adjoint sensitivity study is consistent with a previous regression-based sensitivity study derived from perturbation experiments. Finally, implication for ENSO monitoring and prediction is also discussed.

A 50-year long simulation by a coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (CGCM) is compared with another of the same length in which Greenland melting is prescribed. To highlight the importance of coupled atmosphere–ocean processes, the CGCM results are compared with those of two other experiments carried out with the oceanic general circulation model (OGCM). In one of these OGCM experiments, the prescribed surface fluxes of heat, momentum and freshwater correspond to the unperturbed simulation by the CGCM; in the other experiment, Greenland melting is added to the freshwater flux. The responses by the CGCM and OGCM to the Greenland melting have similar patterns in the Atlantic, albeit the former having five times larger amplitudes in sea surface height anomalies. The CGCM shows likewise stronger variability in all state variables in all ocean basins because the impact of Greenland melting is quickly communicated to all ocean basins via atmospheric bridges. We conclude that the response of the global climate to Greenland ice melting is highly dependent on coupled atmosphere–ocean processes. These lead to reduced latent heat flux into the atmosphere and an associated increase in net freshwater flux into the ocean, especially in the subpolar North Atlantic. The combined result is a stronger response of the coupled system to Greenland ice sheet melting.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dwivedi, S.</author><author>Haine, T.

Ocean variations associated with fishing conditions for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1063–1071. In this study, the Taiwanese longline (LL) fishery data were divided into two types: regular LL and deep LL. Furthermore, we collected environmental variables, such as sea surface temperature (SST), subsurface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, net primary productivity, windspeed, and the north tropical Atlantic SST index (NTA) during the period 1998–2007 to investigate the relationship between LL catch data and oceanic environmental factors using principal component analysis (PCA). After the daily LL was separated into two types of LL, the results indicated that the deep LL was the major fishery catching yellowfin tuna (YFT) in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. In 2003–2005, especially in 2005, the monthly catch by deep LL was double those of other years. The spatial distribution of the nominal catch per unit effort (cpue) by deep LL showed the maximum aggregation of YFT in waters with temperature above 24–25°C. The YFT mainly aggregated in the equatorial Atlantic, extending east in the first and second quarters of the year. In the third quarter of the year, the SST decreased off West Africa and the YFT migrated westwards to 15°W. Results of PCA indicated that higher subsurface water temperatures resulted in a deeper thermocline and caused a higher cpue of YFT, but the influence of NTA on the cpue of YFT seemed to be insignificant.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hernandez, Fabrice</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Schiller, Andreas</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Performance of Ocean Forecasting Systems—Intercomparison Projects</title><secondary-title>Operational Oceanography in the 21st Century</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Operational Oceanography in the 21st Century</full-title></periodical><pages>633-655</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>Dordrecht</pub-location><publisher>Springer Netherlands</publisher><isbn>978-94-007-0331-5</isbn><accession-num>25246403</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-94-007-0332-2_23</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hernandez, F.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seoane, L.</author><author>Nastula, J.</author><author>Bizouard, C.</author><author>Gambis, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrological excitation of polar motion derived from GRACE gravity field solutions</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Geophysics</full-title></periodical><volume>2011</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>9783319246031</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2011/174396</electronic-resource-num><notes>Seoane, L., Nastula, J., Bizouard, C., &amp;amp; Gambis, D.

Different models have been developed to evaluate these effects and compared to geodetic observations. However, previous studies have shown large discrepancies mainly attributed to the lack of global measurements of related hydrological parameters. Now, from the observations of the GRACE mission, we can estimate the polar motion excitation due to the global hydrology. Data processing of GRACE data is carried out by several centers of analysis, we focus on the new solution computed by the Groupe de Recherche de Géodésie Spatiale. At annual scales, excitations derived from GRACE data are in better agreement with geodetic observations than models estimates. The main contribution to the hydrological excitation comes from the monsoon climates regions where GRACE and models estimates are in a very good agreement. Still, the effect of the north high latitudes regions, where the principal areas of snow cover are found, cannot be neglected. At these regions, GRACE and models estimated contributions to polar motion excitations show significant discrepancies. Finally, GRACE-based excitations reveal the possible influence of water storage variations in exciting polar motion around the frequency of 3 cycles per year.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tulloch, Ross</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Jahn, Oliver</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Possible Spreadings of Buoyant Plumes and Local Coastline Sensitivities Using Flow Syntheses From 1992 to 2007</title><secondary-title>Monitoring and Modeling the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: A Record-Breaking Enterprise</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Monitoring and Modeling the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: A Record-Breaking Enterprise</full-title></periodical><pages>245-255</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>American Geophysical Union</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011GM001125</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tulloch, R., Hill, C., &amp;amp; Jahn, O.

Ocean currents are taken from observationally constrained Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Phase 2 (ECCO2) project state estimates spanning 1992 to 2007. Starting from this basis, we explore the utility of adjoint equations in allowing proactive evaluation of regional impact likelihood. Forward integrations are performed to assess the ensemble spread of the plume, the role of increased resolution of ocean eddies, and to compare spreading metrics using an Eulerian tracer and Lagrangian particles. Spreading statistics compare well with previous studies, and the Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches predict similar spread- ing rates, allowing some confidence in adjoint sensitivity analysis of the vulnerability of different local coastline regions to be conducted. Example adjoint calculations indicate that coastline of the Mississippi Delta is most sensitive to spills on the continental shelf off adjacent to Mississippi and Alabama, while Cape Hatteras, for example, is most sensitive to spills on the continental shelf from Delaware to South Carolina. Combined with accurate estimates of historical currents and winds, we argue that the adjoint approach we describe can be a useful regional planning and preparedness tool. Using the adjoint approach, local communities can proactively identify spill locations to which they are especially vulnerable, allowing for better preparedness and more efficient response to any future incidents.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Drozdowski, A.</author><author>Nudds, S.</author><author>Hannah, C.

The primary goals are a synthesis of the state-of-knowledge on oil spill trajectory modelling and the identification of the key gaps in this knowledge as it applies to the Canadian Arctic. The review addresses all the components of a comprehensive oil spill trajectory model including 1) a blowout plume model to determine the distribution of oil in the water column for spills that occur at depth, 2) models for the physical environmental forcing (wind, air temperature, precipitation, ocean currents, sea ice and waves); and 3) an oil fate-and-effects model to address weathering, evaporation, ice-oil interactions, and other details of the oil’s interplay with the environment. Novel challenges presented by the Arctic environment include the presence of sea ice, sparse observations of ocean currents and limited ability to monitor the spill’s evolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Firing, Yvonne L</author><author>Chereskin, Teresa K</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vertical structure and transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in Drake Passage from direct velocity observations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>n/a{\textendash}n/a</pages><volume>116</volume><issue>C8</issue><keywords><keyword>Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>Descriptive and regional oceanography</keyword><keyword>Drake Passage</keyword><keyword>Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>Fronts and jets</keyword><keyword>acoustic Doppler current profiler</keyword><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>currents</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JC006999</electronic-resource-num><notes>Firing, Y.

The extended 1000 m depth range available from the 38 kHz ADCP allows us to investigate the vertical structure of the current. The mean observed current varies slowly with depth, while eddy kinetic energy and shear variance exhibit strong depth dependence. Objectively mapped streamlines are self-similar with depth, consistent with an equivalent barotropic structure. Vertical wavenumber spectra of observed currents and current shear reveal intermediate wavenumber anisotropy and rotation indicative of downward energy propagation above 500 m and upward propagation below 500 m. The mean observed transport of the ACC in the upper 1000 m is estimated at 95 {\textpm} 2 Sv or 71% of the canonical total transport of 134 Sv. Mean current speeds in the ACC jets remain quite strong at 1000 m, 10{\textendash}20 cm s-1. Vertical structure functions to describe the current and extrapolate below 1000 m are explored with the aid of full-depth profiles from lowered ADCP and a 3 year mean from the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE). A number of functions, including an exponential, are nearly equally good fits to the observations, explaining &gt;75% of the variance. Fits to an exponentially decaying function can be extrapolated to give an estimate of 154 {\textpm} 38 Sv for the full-depth transport.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cerovečki, Ivana</author><author>Talley, Lynne D.</author><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Comparison of Southern Ocean Air–Sea Buoyancy Flux from an Ocean State Estimate with Five Other Products</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>6283-6306</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>Air-sea interaction</keyword><keyword>Buoyancy</keyword><keyword>Fluxes</keyword><keyword>Model comparis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>American Meteorological Society</publisher><isbn>0894-8755</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2011JCLI3858.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cerovečki, I., L.

The large-scale pattern of SOSE and Large and Yeager turbulent heat flux adjustment is similar, but the magnitude of SOSE adjustments is significantly larger. Their radiative heat flux adjustments patterns differ. Turbulent heat fluxes determined by combining COARE bulk formulas with NCEP1 or ERA should not be combined with unmodified NCEP1 or ERA radiative fluxes as the net ocean heat gain poleward of 25°S becomes unrealistically large. The other surface flux products (i.e., NCEP1, ERA, Large and Yeager, and SOSE) balance more closely.Overall, the statistical estimates of the differences between the various air–sea heat flux products tend to be largest in regions with strong ocean mesoscale activity such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the western boundary currents.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of the Indo-Pacific Ocean exchanges</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>157-173</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ITF</keyword><keyword>Indonesian Seas</keyword><keyword>Ocean general circulation</keyword><keyword>State estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2009.12.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C.

Apart from the details of the unresolved flows within the various passages, and right on the equator, the region and its large-scale climate effects appears to be accurately diagnosed by large-scale geostrophic balance, so that the ITF can be calculated either from the upstream or the downstream balanced flow (but no simple reference level can be defined).

Specifically, skill was assessed based on the models' ability to estimate the observed mean, variability, and trends of NPP. At both sites, more than 90% of the models underestimated mean NPP, with the average bias of the BOGCMs being nearly twice that of the ocean color models. However, the difference in overall skill between the best BOGCM and the best ocean color model at each site was not significant. Between 1989 and 2007, in situ NPP at BATS and HOT increased by an average of nearly 2% per year and was positively correlated to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index. The majority of ocean color models produced in situ NPP trends that were closer to the observed trends when chlorophyll-a was derived from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), rather than fluorometric or SeaWiFS data. However, this was a function of time such that average trend magnitude was more accurately estimated over longer time periods. Among BOGCMs, only two individual models successfully produced an increasing NPP trend (one model at each site). We caution against the use of models to assess multiannual changes in NPP over short time periods. Ocean color model estimates of NPP trends could improve if more high quality HPLC chlorophyll-a time series were available.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Eddy-Permitting Southern Ocean State Estimate</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>880-899</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Eddies</keyword><keyword>Meridional</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2009JPO4236.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mazloff, M.

Data used include Argo float profiles, CTD synoptic sections, Southern Elephant Seals as Oceanographic Samplers (SEaOS) instrument-mounted seal profiles, XBTs, altimetric observations [Envisat, Geosat, Jason-1, and Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon], and infrared and microwave radiometer observed sea surface temperature. An adjoint model is used to determine descent directions in minimizing a misfit function, each of whose elements has been weighted by an estimate of the observational plus model error. The model is brought into near agreement with the data by adjusting its control vector, here consisting of initial and meteorological boundary conditions. Although total consistency has not yet been achieved, the existing solution is in good agreement with the great majority of the 2005 and 2006 Southern Ocean observations and better represents these data than does the World Ocean Atlas 2001 (WOA01) climatological product. The estimate captures the oceanic temporal variability and in this respect represents a major improvement upon earlier static inverse estimates. During the estimation period, the Drake Passage volume transport is 153 ± 5 Sv (1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1). The Ross and Weddell polar gyre transports are 20 ± 5 Sv and 40 ± 8 Sv, respectively. Across 32°S there is a surface meridional overturning cell of 12 ± 12 Sv, an intermediate cell of 17 ± 12 Sv, and an abyssal cell of 13 ± 6 Sv. The northward heat and freshwater anomaly transports across 30°S are −0.3 PW and 0.7 Sv, with estimated uncertainties of 0.5 PW and 0.2 Sv. The net rate of wind work is 2.1 ± 1.1 TW. Southern Ocean theories involving short temporal- and spatial-scale dynamics may now be tested with a dynamically and thermodynamically realistic general circulation model solution that is known to be compatible with the modern observational datasets.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freeman, Anthony</author><author>Zlotnicki, Victor</author><author>Liu, Tim</author><author>Holt, Benjamin</author><author>Kwok, Ron</author><author>Yueh, Simon</author><author>Vazquez, Jorge</author><author>Siegel, David</author><author>Lagerloef, Gary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Measurements from Space in 2025</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>144-161</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2010.12</electronic-resource-num><notes>Freeman, A., Zlotnicki, V., Liu, T., Holt, B., Kwok, R., Yueh, S., … Lagerloef, G.

Estimates of geostrophic transport from the data are compared with the model transport to close the volume budget north of the trans-Pacific XBT track. Advective transport from both model output and data are combined with surface fluxes to determine budgets of heat and freshwater in the closed region. The northward heat transport across the XBT track is estimated to be 0.74 ± 0.1 pW, and has variability of almost 0.5 pW on 3-4 year time scales, while freshwater transport is estimated to be - 0.1 ± 0.06 Sv. The balance between northward advective heat transport and surface heat flux gives a time-varying estimate of heat storage that compares well with observations. A similar balance is found between model estimates of advective freshwater transport and surface freshwater flux. Despite a scarcity of observations and uncertainties in all components, this analysis results in nearly closed budgets of volume, heat, and freshwater. Mean estimates of advective transport of both heat and freshwater agree with previous estimates. An analysis of each component of the heat budget with latitude indicates that a relative lack of time-variability of the surface component is consistent throughout the North Pacific. The dominant advective component is driven by changes in the wind stress curl field. For both heat and freshwater storage, strong signals occur concurrently at all latitudes. This behavior could indicate that these signals are controlled by large-scale dynamics, rather than small-scale disturbances from which signals would need to propagate to be widely felt. The analysis demonstrates the value of bringing models and data together, resulting in budgets that are consistent with observations, yet provide a comprehensive look at the variability of North Pacific heat and freshwater storage that would be unavailable from data alone. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined a global ocean circulation, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem model that indicated a decrease in phytoplankton diversity with increasing latitude, consistent with observations of many marine and terrestrial taxa. In the modeled subpolar oceans, seasonal variability of the environment led to competitive exclusion of phytoplankton with slower growth rates and lower diversity. The relatively weak seasonality of the stable subtropical and tropical oceans in the global model enabled long exclusion time scales and prolonged coexistence of multiple phytoplankton with comparable fitness. Superimposed on the decline in diversity seen from equator to pole were “hot spots” of enhanced diversity in some regions of energetic ocean circulation, which reflected lateral dispersal.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hall, J</author><author>Harrison, D E</author><author>Stammer, D</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Information Provided Through Ensemble Ocean Syntheses</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of OceanObs'09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of OceanObs'09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society</full-title></periodical><pages>920-930</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>Venice, Italy, 21-25 September 2009</pub-location><publisher>European Space Agency</publisher><isbn>978-3-86987-200-1</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5270/OceanObs09.cwp.85</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., and Coauthors, 2010: Ocean Information Provided Through Ensemble Ocean Syntheses.

There are several possible approaches to address these tasks. One with much potential for future ocean information services and for climate predictions is called ocean synthesis, and is concerned with merging all available ocean observations with the dynamics embedded in an ocean circulation model to obtain estimates of the changing ocean that are more accurate than either system alone can provide. The field of ocean synthesis has matured over the last decade. Several global ocean syntheses exist today and can be used to investigate key scientific questions, such as changes in sea level, heat content, or transports. This CWP (Community White Paper) summarizes climate variability as “seen” by several ocean syntheses, describes similarities and differences in these solutions and uses results to highlight developments necessary over the next decade to improve ocean products and services. It appears that multi-model ensemble approaches can be useful to obtain better estimates of the ocean. To make full use of such a system, though, one needs detailed error information not only about data and models, but also about the estimated states. Results show that estimates tend to cluster around methodologies and therefore are not necessarily independent from each other. Results also reveal the impact of a historically under-sampled ocean on estimates of inter-decadal variability in the ocean. To improve future estimates, we need not only to sustain the existing observing system but to extend it to include full-depth Argo-type measurements, enhanced information about boundary currents and transports through key regions, and to keep all important satellite sensors flying indefinitely, including altimetry, gravimetry and ice thickness, microwave SST (Sea Surface Temperature) observations, wind stress measurements and ocean color. We also need to maintain ocean state estimation as an integral part of the ocean observing and information system.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Durand, M</author><author>Fu, L L</author><author>Lettenmaier, D P</author><author>Alsdorf, D E</author><author>Rodriguez, E</author><author>Esteban-Fernandez, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Surface Water and Ocean Topography Mission: Observing Terrestrial Surface Water and Oceanic Submesoscale Eddies</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the IEEE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the IEEE</full-title></periodical><pages>766-779</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Arctic lakes</keyword><keyword>Extraterrestrial measurements</keyword><keyword>Hydrologic measurements</keyword><keyword>Interferometry</keyword><keyword>Ka-band radar interferometer</keyword><keyword>KaRIN</keyword><keyword>Oceans</keyword><keyword>Sea measurements</keyword><keyword>Sea surface</keyword><keyword>Spaceborne radar</keyword><keyword>Surface Water and Ocean Topography Mission</keyword><keyword>Surface discharges</keyword><keyword>Surface topography</keyword><keyword>Water storage</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>hydrological techniques</keyword><keyword>hydrology</keyword><keyword>inland water bodies</keyword><keyword>lakes</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean surface elevation</keyword><keyword>oceanic submesoscale eddies</keyword><keyword>oceanographic techniques</keyword><keyword>oceanography</keyword><keyword>oceanograpy</keyword><keyword>radar interferometry</keyword><keyword>remote sensing</keyword><keyword>remote sensing by radar</keyword><keyword>reservoirs</keyword><keyword>river discharge</keyword><keyword>rivers</keyword><keyword>spaceborne altimeter</keyword><keyword>streams</keyword><keyword>surface water hydrology</keyword><keyword>swath altimetry</keyword><keyword>synthetic aperture radar</keyword><keyword>terrestrial hydrology</keyword><keyword>terrestrial surface water</keyword><keyword>water storage change</keyword><keyword>water surface elevation</keyword><keyword>wetlands</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/JPROC.2010.2043031</electronic-resource-num><notes>Durand, M., L.

However, existing altimeter measurements are not adequate to characterize the dynamic variations of most inland water bodies, nor of ocean eddies at scales of less than about 100 km, notwithstanding that such eddies play a key role in ocean circulation and climate change. For terrestrial hydrology, in situ and spaceborne measurements of water surface elevation form the basis for estimates of water storage change in lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands, and of river discharge. However, storage in most inland water bodies, e.g., millions of Arctic lakes, is not readily measured using existing technologies. A solution to the needs of both surface water hydrology and physical oceanography communities is the measurement of water elevations along rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands and over the ocean surface using swath altimetry. The proposed surface water and ocean topography (SWOT) mission will make such measurements. The core technology for SWOT is the Ka-band radar interferometer (KaRIN), which would achieve spatial resolution on the order of tens of meters and centimetric vertical precision when averaged over targets of interest. Average revisit times will depend upon latitude, with two to four revisits at low to mid latitudes and up to ten revisits at high latitudes per ~20-day orbit repeat period.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tamisiea, M E</author><author>Hill, E M</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Davis, J L</author><author>Velicogna, I</author><author>Vinogradova, N T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of self-attraction and loading on the annual cycle in sea level</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>115</volume><issue>C7</issue><keywords><keyword>1223 Geodesy and Gravity: Ocean/Earth/atmosphere/h</keyword><keyword>4227 Oceanography: General: Diurnal, seasonal, and</keyword><keyword>4556 Oceanography: Physical: Sea level: variations</keyword><keyword>annual cycle</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword><keyword>self-attraction and loading</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JC005687</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tamisiea, M.

However, the global average amplitude of this annual cycle (observed amplitude of ∼8 mm) is not representative of the effects that would be observed at individual tide gauges or at ocean bottom pressure recorders because of self-attraction and loading effects (SAL). In this paper, we examine the spatial variation of sea level change caused by the three main components that load the Earth and contribute to the water cycle: hydrology (including snow), the atmosphere, and the dynamic ocean. The SAL effects cause annual amplitudes at tide gauges (modeled here with a global average of ∼9 mm) to vary from less than 2 mm to more than 18 mm. We find a variance reduction (global average of 3 to 4%) after removing the modeled time series from a global set of tide gauges. We conclude that SAL effects are significant in places (e.g., the south central Pacific and coastal regions in Southeast Asia and west central Africa) and should be considered when interpreting these data sets and using them to constrain ocean circulation models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vinogradova, Nadya T</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Tamisiea, Mark E</author><author>Davis, James L</author><author>Hill, Emma M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of self-attraction and loading on annual variations of ocean bottom pressure</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>115</volume><issue>C6</issue><keywords><keyword>0438 Diel, seasonal, and annual cycles</keyword><keyword>1222 Ocean monitoring with geodetic techniques</keyword><keyword>1223 Ocean/Earth/atmosphere/hydrosphere/cryosphere</keyword><keyword>4263 Ocean predictability and prediction</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>annual cycle</keyword><keyword>ocean bottom pressure</keyword><keyword>self-attraction and loading effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JC005783</electronic-resource-num><notes>Vinogradova, N.

The SAL-related changes in ξ occur as a result of deformation of the crust due to loading and self-gravitation of the variable fluid loads. In the absence of SAL, net freshwater input and changes in mean atmospheric pressure over the ocean give rise to a spatially constant ξ annual cycle with an amplitude ∼1–2 cm in equivalent water thickness. Consideration of SAL physics introduces spatial variations that can be significant, particularly around continental boundaries, where the amplitude of deviations can exceed 1 cm. For the spatial variability induced by SAL effects, changes in both land hydrology and atmospheric pressure are important. Effects related to the changing ocean circulation are relatively weaker, apart from a few shallow coastal regions. Comparisons with a few in situ, deep ocean observations indicate that for the most accurate ξ estimates, one needs to consider spatially varying SAL-related signals, along with the effects of mean atmospheric pressure and net freshwater input into the oceans. Nevertheless, the most complete estimates, including also effects of ocean circulation, are able to account for only ∼1/3 of the observed annual variances. Sources of the remaining contribution remain unclear.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, W Q</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimates of global ocean volume transports during 1960 through 2001</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>37</volume><keywords><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>deep</keyword><keyword>drake passage</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>hydrographic data</keyword><keyword>mass</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010gl043949</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wang, W.

Results confirm previously discussed mean-state ocean circulation systems, encompassing an upper meridional cell in the Atlantic with sinking in the North Atlantic connected to a lower meridional cell with sinking around Antarctica in the Pacific and Atlantic. Decadal to interdecadal variability as well as long-term trends of global ocean transport, analyzed over the course of the 42 years, appear as a reorganization of time-mean circulation structures, including the layer transports in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the circulation involving the Indo-Pacific exchange.

An experimental setup covering the first deployment period of RAPID-MOCHA from March 2004 to March 2005 is used to test different strategies for incorporating these datasets. Incorporating both monthly means of the FC data and monthly means of the RAPID-MOCHA temperature and salinity measurements at the eastern and western boundaries of the basin as an observational constraint in a 1-yr experiment results in an adjustment to the reference estimate, which does not include these datasets, of approximately 1 Sv (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) in the MOC at 26 degrees N and the adjacent latitudes (approximately +/- 15 degrees), with a larger northward branch of the MOC above 1000 m, compensated by a larger flow in the southward branch of the MOC between approximately 2000 and 3000 m. The meridional heat transport from 26 degrees N to near 40 degrees N is approximately 0.05 PW larger than in the reference experiment.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author><author>Lee, Tong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms of the meridional heat transport in the Southern Ocean</title><secondary-title>Ocean Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Dynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>791-801</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10236-010-0288-0</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

A global ocean data synthesis product at eddy-permitting resolution from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2) project is used to estimate the meridional heat transport (MHT) in the SO and to analyze its mechanisms. Despite the intense eddy activity, we demonstrate that most of the poleward MHT in the SO is due to the time-mean fields of the meridional velocity, V, and potential temperature, θ. This is because the mean circulation in the SO is not strictly zonal. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current carries warm waters from the region south of the Agulhas Retroflection to the lower latitudes of the Drake Passage and the Malvinas Current carries cold waters northward along the Argentinian shelf. Correlations between the time-varying fields of V and θ (defined as transient processes) significantly contribute to the horizontal-gyre heat transport, but not the overturning heat transport. In the highly energetic regions of the Agulhas Retroflection and the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence the contribution of the horizontal transient processes to the total MHT exceeds the contribution of the mean horizontal flow. We show that the southward total MHT is mainly maintained by the meridional excursion of the mean geostrophic horizontal shear flow (i.e., deviation from the zonal average) associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that balances the equatorward MHT due to the Ekman transport and provides a net poleward MHT in the SO. The Indian sector of the SO serves as the main pathway for the poleward MHT.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Werf, P M</author><author>van Leeuwen, P J</author><author>Ridderinkhof, H</author><author>de Ruijter, W P M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison between observations and models of the Mozambique Channel transport: Seasonal cycle and eddy frequencies</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>115</volume><issue>C2</issue><keywords><keyword>0550 Model verification and validation</keyword><keyword>4277 Time series experiments</keyword><keyword>4512 Currents</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>Indian Ocean</keyword><keyword>Mozambique Channel</keyword><keyword>comparison observations and models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JC005633</electronic-resource-num><notes>van der Werf, P.

In the observations, the seasonal cycle cannot be distinguished from red noise, while this cycle is dominant in the transport of the numerical models. It is found, however, that the seasonal cycles of the observations and numerical models are similar in strength and phase. These cycles have an amplitude of 5 Sv and a maximum in September, and can be explained by the yearly variation of the wind forcing. The seasonal cycle in the models is dominant because the spectral density at other frequencies is underrepresented. Main deviations from the observations are found at depths shallower than 1500 m and in the 5/y–6/y frequency range. Nevertheless, the structure of eddies in the models is close to the observed eddy structure. The discrepancy is found to be related to the formation mechanism and the formation position of the eddies. In the observations, eddies are frequently formed from an overshooting current near the mooring section, as proposed by Ridderinkhof and de Ruijter (2003) and Harlander et al. (2009). This causes an alternation of events at the mooring section, varying between a strong southward current, and the formation and passing of an eddy. This results in a large variation of transport in the frequency range of 5/y–6/y. In the models, the eddies are formed further north and propagate through the section. No alternation similar to the observations is observed, resulting in a more constant transport.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Monteiro, F M</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distribution of diverse nitrogen fixers in the global ocean</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>24</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>0414 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>0460 Marine systems</keyword><keyword>0469 Nitrogen cycling</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>biodiversity</keyword><keyword>biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>modeling</keyword><keyword>nitrogen fixation</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009GB003731</electronic-resource-num><notes>Monteiro, F.

In the model, the structure of the marine phytoplankton community self-assembles from a large number of potentially viable physiologies. Amongst them, analogs of Trichodesmium, unicellular diazotrophs and diatom-diazotroph associations (DDA) are successful and abundant. The simulated biogeography and nitrogen fixation rates of the modeled diazotrophs compare favorably with a compilation of published observations, which includes both traditional and molecular measurements of abundance and activity of marine diazotrophs. In the model, the diazotroph analogs occupy warm subtropical and tropical waters, with higher concentrations and nitrogen fixation rates in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Arabian Sea/Northern Indian Ocean, and lower values in the tropical and subtropical South Pacific Ocean. The three main diazotroph types typically co-exist in the model, although Trichodesmium analogs dominate the diazotroph population in much of the North and tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Arabian Sea, while unicellular-diazotroph analogs dominate in the South Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. This pattern reflects the relative degree of nutrient limitation by iron or phosphorus. The model suggests in addition that unicellular diazotrophs could add as much new nitrogen to the global ocean as Trichodesmium.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Willis, Josh K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can in situ floats and satellite altimeters detect long-term changes in Atlantic Ocean overturning?</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>37</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>1616 Climate variability</keyword><keyword>1635 Oceans</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>Altimeter</keyword><keyword>Argo</keyword><keyword>Atlantic Overturning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010GL042372</electronic-resource-num><notes>Willis, J.

Here, satellite observations of sea surface height (SSH) along with temperature, salinity and velocity from profiling floats are used to estimate changes in the northward-flowing, upper limb of the AMOC at latitudes around 41°N. The 2004 through 2006 mean overturning is found to be 15.5 ± 2.4 Sv (106 m3/s) with somewhat smaller seasonal and interannual variability than at lower latitudes. There is no significant trend in overturning strength between 2002 and 2009. Altimeter data, however, suggest an increase of 2.6 Sv since 1993, consistent with North Atlantic warming during this same period. Despite significant seasonal to interannual fluctuations, these observations demonstrate that substantial slowing of the AMOC did not occur during the past 7 years and is unlikely to have occurred in the past 2 decades.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, S G</author><author>Chambers, D P</author><author>Tapley, B D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrological and oceanic effects on polar motion from GRACE and models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><volume>115</volume><keywords><keyword>atmospheric excitation</keyword><keyword>chandler-wobble</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>currents</keyword><keyword>earths variable rotation</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>length</keyword><keyword>seasonal-variations</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009jb006635</electronic-resource-num><notes>Jin, S.

However, quantitative assessment of the hydrological and oceanic effects on polar motion remains unclear because of the lack of global observations. In this paper, hydrological and oceanic mass excitations to polar motion are investigated using monthly TWS and OBP derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) for January 2003 until December 2008. The results from this analysis are compared with hydrological model excitations from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and oceanic model excitations obtained from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) using Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO). Results show that the GRACE-derived OBP and TWS better explain the geodetic residual polar motion excitations for the Px component at the annual period, while the GRACE OBP and ECMWF hydrological angular momentum agree better with the geodetic residuals for the annual Py excitation. GRACE ocean and hydrology excitations better explain the geodetic residuals for the semiannual Py excitation. However, the JPL ECCO and ECMWF models better explain the intraseasonal geodetic residual of polar motion excitation in the Px and Py components. The GRACE data demonstrate much higher intraseasonal variability than either the models or the geodetic observations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fenty, Ian Gouverneur</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State estimation of the Labrador Sea with a coupled sea ice-ocean adjoint model</title></titles><periodical/><pages>277</pages><volume>Ph.D.</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><notes>Fenty, I.

The result shows that the 13 degrees C Water initialized in the region 8 degrees N-8 degrees S, 130 degrees-90 degrees W enters the surface mixed layer in the eastern tropical Pacific, mainly through upwelling near the equator, in the Costa Rica Dome, and along the coast of Peru. Approximately two-thirds of this obduction occurs within 10 years after the 13 degrees C Water being initialized, with the upper portion of the water mass reaching the surface mixed layer in only about a month. The obduction of the 13 degrees C Water helps to maintain a cool sea surface temperature year-round, equivalent to a surface heat flux of about -6.0 W m(-2) averaged over the eastern tropical Pacific (15 degrees S-15 degrees N, 130 degrees W-eastern boundary) for the period of integration (1993-2006). During El Nino years, when the thermocline deepens as a consequence of the easterly wind weakening, the obduction of the 13 degrees C Water is suppressed, and the reduced vertical entrainment generates a warming anomaly of up to 10 W m(-2) in the eastern tropical Pacific and in particular along the coast of Peru, providing explanations for the warming of sea surface temperature that cannot be accounted for by local winds alone. The situation is reversed during La Nina years.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Forget, G</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Balmaseda, M</author><author>Awaji, T</author><author>Baehr, J</author><author>Behringer, D</author><author>Carton, J</author><author>Ferry, N</author><author>Fischer, A</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Giese, B</author><author>Haines, K</author><author>Harrison, E</author><author>Hernandez, F</author><author>Kamachi, M</author><author>Keppenne, C</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Oke, P</author><author>Remy, E</author><author>Rienecker, M</author><author>Rosati, A</author><author>Smith, D</author><author>Speer, K</author><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Weaver, A</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hall, J</author><author>Harrison, D E</author><author>Stammer, D</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Observational Requirements for Global-Scale Ocean Climate Analysis: Lessons from Ocean State Estimation</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society (Vol. 2)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society (Vol. 2)</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>Venice, Italy, 21-25 September 2009</pub-location><publisher>ESA Publication WPP-306</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5270/OceanObs09.cwp.42</electronic-resource-num><notes>Heimbach, P., and Coauthors, 2010: Observational Requirements for Global-Scale Ocean Climate Analysis: Lessons from Ocean State Estimation.

These data are used to construct a purely empirical and analytical frequency–zonal wavenumber spectrum of ocean variability for periods between about 20 days and 15 yr and on spatial scales of about 200–10 000 km. The spectrum is dominated by motions along a “nondispersive” line, which is a robust feature of the data but for whose prominence a complete theoretical explanation is not available. The estimated spectrum also contains significant energy at all frequencies and wavenumbers in this range, including eastward-propagating motions, which are likely some combination of nonlinear spectral cascades, wave propagation, and wind-forced motions. The spectrum can be used to calculate statistical expectations of spatial average sea level and transport variations. However, because the statistics of trend determination in quantities such as sea level and volume transports depend directly upon the spectral limit of the frequency approaching zero, the appropriate significance calculations remain beyond reach, because low-frequency variability is indistinguishable from trends already present in the data.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Au, Whitlow</author><author>Beszczynska-Möller, Agnieszka</author><author>Brainard, Rusty</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce D</author><author>Duda, Tim</author><author>Dzieciuch, Matthew</author><author>Forbes, Andrew</author><author>Freitag, Lee</author><author>Gascard, Jean-Claude</author><author>Gavrilov, Alexander</author><author>Gould, John</author><author>Howe, Bruce</author><author>Jayne, Steven R</author><author>Johannessen, Ola M</author><author>Lynch, James F</author><author>Martin, David</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mikhalevsky, Peter</author><author>Miller, James H</author><author>Moore, Sue E</author><author>Munk, Walter H</author><author>Nystuen, Jeff</author><author>Odom, Robert I</author><author>Orcutt, John</author><author>Rossby, Tom</author><author>Sagen, Hanne</author><author>Sandven, Stein</author><author>Simmen, Jeff</author><author>Skarsoulis, Emmanuel</author><author>Southall, Brandon</author><author>Stafford, Kate</author><author>Stephen, Ralph</author><author>Vigness-Raposa, Kathleen J</author><author>Vinogradov, Sergei</author><author>Wong, Kevin B</author><author>Worcester, Peter F</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hall, J</author><author>Harrison, D E</author><author>Stammer, D</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>A global ocean acoustic observing network</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society</full-title></periodical><volume>2</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>Venice, Italy, 21-25 September 2009</pub-location><publisher>ESA Publication WPP-306</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5270/OceanObs09.cwp.25</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dushaw, B.

Previous studies have noted a lag of atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) with LOD that would imply another source. We examine AAM from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis series, along with oceanic angular momentum (OAM) from the ECCO consortium; land hydrological effects made no discernible impact. The NCEP reanalysis together with OAM produces a significant lag with LOD, while the ECMWF reanalysis AAM with OAM shows no phase lag. We find significant coherence with LOD variations down to periods of 4 days; coherence losses at shorter periods likely arise from the inverted barometer assumption and unmodeled dynamical processes. Thus the inclusion of core effects is not needed to balance the axial angular momentum budget on sub-seasonal time scales. Citation: Dickey, J. O., S. L.

Initial temperature and salinity perturbations leading to an optimal growth of tropical SST anomalies, typically arising from the nonnormal dynamics, are evaluated. The structure of the optimal perturbations is characterized by relatively strong deep salinity anomalies near the western boundary generating a transient amplification of equatorial SST anomalies in less than four years. The associated growth mechanism is linked to the excitation of coastal and equatorial Kelvin waves near the western boundary following a rapid geostrophic adjustment owing to the optimal initial temperature and salinity perturbations. The results suggest that the nonnormality of the ocean dynamics may efficiently create large tropical SST variability on interannual time scales in the Atlantic without the participation of air–sea processes or the meridional overturning circulation. An optimal deep initial salinity perturbation of 0.1 ppt located near the western boundary can result in a tropical SST anomaly of approximately 0.45°C after nearly four years, assuming the dynamics are linear. Possible mechanisms for exciting such deep perturbations are discussed. While this study is motivated by tropical Atlantic SST variability, its relevance to other basins is not excluded. The optimal initial conditions leading to the tropical SST anomalies’ growth are obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. The evaluation of the optimals is achieved by using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) tangent linear and adjoint models as well the the Arnoldi Package (ARPACK) software for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Reasons for the Formation and Variability of the Azores Current</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2197-2220</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Currents</keyword><keyword>Gyres</keyword><keyword>Mediterranean Sea</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2010JPO4326.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

As the denser Mediterranean water descends down the continental slope, it entrains overlying North Atlantic Central Water. It is believed that the Azores Current then forms as part of the horizontal recirculating gyre generated through the β-plume mechanism. In this study, the authors further explore this hypothesis by performing a series of numerical experiments. These experiments are based on a high-resolution general circulation model that includes the Mediterranean Sea and that realistically simulates the water mass exchange through the Strait of Gibraltar and the transport and variability of the Azores Current. The authors show that the divergence of the relative vorticity flux and the planetary vorticity flux, associated with planetary waves, are the main factors determining the variability of the Azores Current. It is shown experimentally that the closure of the Strait of Gibraltar leads to a complete disappearance of the Azores Current. On the other hand, with the open Strait of Gibraltar, the Azores Current persists even when the wind forcing over the region is turned off. The atmospheric forcing is thus not responsible for the formation of the Azores Current, but it affects the variability of the current with a minor effect on its magnitude. Numerical experiments suggest that the strength and the variability of the Azores Current depend on the magnitude of the water mass exchange through the Strait of Gibraltar but not on its seasonal variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abernathey, Ryan</author><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Mazloff, Matt</author><author>Shuckburgh, Emily</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancement of Mesoscale Eddy Stirring at Steering Levels in the Southern Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>170-184</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Eddies,Mesoscale processes,Southern Ocean,Diffusio</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2009JPO4201.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Abernathey, R., J.

The effective diffusivity, Keff, characterizes the rate at which mesoscale eddies stir properties on interior isopycnal surfaces and laterally at the sea surface. The distributions are obtained by monitoring the rate at which eddies stir an idealized tracer whose initial distribution varies monotonically across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). In the absence of observed maps of eddying currents in the interior ocean, the advecting velocity field is taken from an eddy-permitting state estimate of the Southern Ocean (SOSE). A three-dimensional advection–diffusion equation is solved and the diffusivity diagnosed by applying the Nakamura technique on both horizontal and isopycnal surfaces. The resulting meridional sections of Keff reveal intensified isopycnal eddy stirring (reaching values of ∼2000 m2 s−1) in a layer deep beneath the ACC but rising toward the surface on the equatorward flank. Lower effective diffusivity values (∼500 m2 s−1) are found near the surface where the mean flow of the ACC is strongest. It is argued that Keff is enhanced in the vicinity of the steering level of baroclinic waves, which is deep along the axis of the ACC but shallows on the equatorial flank. Values of Keff are also found to be spatially correlated with gradients of potential vorticity on isopycnal surfaces and are large where those gradients are weak and vice versa, as expected from simple dynamical arguments. Finally, implications of the spatial distributions of Keff for the dynamics of the ACC and its overturning circulation are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bragg, Jason G</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Jahn, Oliver</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Chisholm, Sallie W</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>DeSalle, Robert</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling Selective Pressures on Phytoplankton in the Global Ocean</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e9569</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>biogeography</keyword><keyword>cyanobacteria</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>forms</keyword><keyword>genome</keyword><keyword>lineages</keyword><keyword>marine synechococcus</keyword><keyword>nitrate assimilation</keyword><keyword>nitrogen</keyword><keyword>prochlorococcus ecotypes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0009569</electronic-resource-num><notes>Bragg, J.

It is difficult to assimilate this information into our understanding of marine microbe ecology and evolution, because their distributions, traits, and genomes are shaped by forces that are complex and dynamic. Here we incorporate diverse forces-physical, biogeochemical, ecological, and mutational-into a global ocean model to study selective pressures on a simple trait in a widely distributed lineage of picophytoplankton: the nitrogen use abilities of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria. Some Prochlorococcus ecotypes have lost the ability to use nitrate, whereas their close relatives, marine Synechococcus, typically retain it. We impose mutations for the loss of nitrogen use abilities in modeled picophytoplankton, and ask: in which parts of the ocean are mutants most disadvantaged by losing the ability to use nitrate, and in which parts are they least disadvantaged? Our model predicts that this selective disadvantage is smallest for picophytoplankton that live in tropical regions where Prochlorococcus are abundant in the real ocean. Conversely, the selective disadvantage of losing the ability to use nitrate is larger for modeled picophytoplankton that live at higher latitudes, where Synechococcus are abundant. In regions where we expect Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations to cycle seasonally in the real ocean, we find that model ecotypes with seasonal population dynamics similar to Prochlorococcus are less disadvantaged by losing the ability to use nitrate than model ecotypes with seasonal population dynamics similar to Synechococcus. The model predictions for the selective advantage associated with nitrate use are broadly consistent with the distribution of this ability among marine picocyanobacteria, and at finer scales, can provide insights into interactions between temporally varying ocean processes and selective pressures that may be difficult or impossible to study by other means. More generally, and perhaps more importantly, this study introduces an approach for testing hypotheses about the processes that underlie genetic variation among marine microbes, embedded in the dynamic physical, chemical, and biological forces that generate and shape this diversity.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Losch, Martin</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Hill, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the formulation of sea-ice models.

As part of an ongoing effort to extend ECCO to a coupled ocean/sea-ice estimation system, a dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice model has been developed for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). One key requirement is the ability to generate, by means of automatic differentiation (AD), tangent linear (TLM) and adjoint (ADM) model code for the coupled MITgcm ocean/sea-ice system. This second part of a two-part paper describes aspects of the adjoint model. The adjoint ocean and sea-ice model is used to calculate transient sensitivities of solid (ice and snow) freshwater export through Lancaster Sound in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). The adjoint state provides a complementary view of the dynamics. In particular, the transient, multi-year sensitivity patterns reflect dominant pathways and propagation timescales through the CAA as resolved by the model, thus shedding light on causal relationships, in the model, across the Archipelago. The computational cost of inferring such causal relationships from forward model diagnostics alone would be prohibitive. The role of the exact model trajectory around which the adjoint is calculated (and therefore of the exactness of the adjoint) is exposed through calculations using free-slip vs no-slip lateral boundary conditions. Effective ice thickness, sea surface temperature, and precipitation sensitivities, are discussed in detail as examples of the coupled sea-ice/ocean and atmospheric forcing control space. To test the reliability of the adjoint, finite-difference perturbation experiments were performed for each of these elements and the cost perturbations were compared to those “predicted” by the adjoint. Overall, remarkable qualitative and quantitative agreement is found. In particular, the adjoint correctly “predicts” a seasonal sign change in precipitation sensitivities. A physical mechanism for this sign change is presented. The availability of the coupled adjoint opens up the prospect for adjoint-based coupled ocean/sea-ice state estimation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borreguero, Laura Herraiz</author><author>Mottram, Ruth</author><author>Cvijanovic, Ivana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Discussing Progress in Understanding Ice Sheet—Ocean Interactions: Advanced Climate Dynamics Course 2010: Ice Sheet—Ocean Interactions; Lyngen, Norway, 8–19 June 2010</title><secondary-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</full-title></periodical><pages>419</pages><volume>91</volume><issue>45</issue><keywords><keyword>0726 Ice sheets</keyword><keyword>0728 Ice shelves</keyword><keyword>1223 Ocean/Earth/atmosphere/hydrosphere/cryosphere</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>climate dynamics</keyword><keyword>ocean–ice sheet interactions</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword><keyword>summer course</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2010EO450006</electronic-resource-num><notes>Borreguero, L.

Major uncertainties in sea level rise projections relate to the response of ice sheets to sea level rise and the key role that interactions with the ocean may play. Recognizing that probably no comprehensive curriculum currently exists at any single university that covers this novel and interdisciplinary subject, the Advanced Climate Dynamics Courses (ACDC) team brought together a group of 40 international students, postdocs, and lecturers from diverse backgrounds to provide an overview and discussion of state-of-the-art research into ocean—ice sheet interactions and to propose research priorities for the next decade. Among the key issues addressed were small-scale processes near the Antarctic ice shelves and Greenland outlet glaciers. These are fast changing components in the climate system, often related to large-scale forcings (atmospheric teleconnections and oceanic circulation). Progress in understanding and modeling is hampered by the range of scales involved, the lack of observations, and the difficulties in constraining, initializing, and providing adequate boundary conditions for ice sheet and ocean models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferrari, Raffaele</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The distribution of eddy kinetic and potential energies in the global ocean</title><secondary-title>Tellus A</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tellus A</full-title></periodical><pages>92-108</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1600-0870.2009.00432.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ferrari, R., and C.

The nature of the dominant kinetic energy reservoir, that of the balanced variablity, is then found to be indistinguishable in the observations from a sum of barotropic and first baroclinic ordinary quasi-geostrophic modes. Little supporting evidence is available to partition the spectra among forced motions and turbulent cascades, along with significant energy more consistent with weakly non-linear wave dynamics. Linear-response wind-forced motions appear to dominate the high frequency (but subinertial) mooring frequency spectra. Turbulent cascades appear to fill the high wavenumber spectra in altimetric data and numerical simulations. Progress on these issues is hindered by the difficulty in connecting the comparatively easily available frequency spectra with the variety of theoretically predicted wavenumber spectra.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hall, J</author><author>Harrison, D E</author><author>Stammer, D</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Observational network design for climate</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society (Vol. 1)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of OceanObs’09: Sustained Ocean Observations and Information for Society (Vol. 1)</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>Venice, Italy, 21-25 September 2009</pub-location><publisher>ESA Publication WPP-306</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5270/OceanObs09.pp.41</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2010: Observational network design for climate.

A first synthesis for the period 1992-2002 has been obtained using a Green's functions approach. Data constraints include hydrography, altimetry, gravity, drifter, and observations of sea-ice. Although the control space is small (~80 parameters), this first globalocean and sea ice data synthesis substantially reduces large-scale biases and drifts of the model relative to observations and to the baseline integration.

The atlas consists of mapped observations and derived quantities. Together they form a full representation of the ocean state and its seasonal cycle. The mapped observations are primarily altimeter data, satellite SST, and Argo profiles. GCM interpolation is used to synthesize these datasets, and the resulting atlas is a fairly close fit to each one of them. For observed quantities especially, the atlas is a practical means to evaluate free-running GCM simulations and to put field experiments into a broader context. The atlas-derived quantities include the middepth dynamic topography, as well as ocean fluxes of heat and salt freshwater. The atlas is publicly available online (www.ecco-group.org). This paper provides insight into two oceanographic problems that are the subject of vigorous ongoing research. First, regarding ocean circulation estimates, it can be inferred that the RMS uncertainty in modern surface dynamic topography (SDT) estimates is only on the order of 3.5 cm at scales beyond 300 km. In that context, it is found that assumptions of &quot;reference-level&quot; dynamic topography may yield significant errors (of order 2.2 cm or more) in SDT estimates using in situ data. Second, in the perspective of mode water investigations, it is estimated that ocean fluxes (advection plus mixing) largely contribute to the seasonal fluctuation in heat content and freshwater/salt content. Hence, representing the seasonal cycle as a simple interplay of air sea flux and ocean storage would not yield a meaningful approximation. For the salt freshwater seasonal cycle especially, contributions from ocean fluxes usually exceed direct air sea flux contributions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Awaji, T</author><author>Balmaseda, M</author><author>Ferry, N</author><author>Fujii, Y</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Giese, B</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Masina, S</author><author>Remy, E</author><author>Rosati, A</author><author>Schodlok, M</author><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Weaver, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Consistency and fidelity of Indonesian-throughflow total volume transport estimated by 14 ocean data assimilation products</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>201-223</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>climate system</keyword><keyword>gcm</keyword><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>indonesian throughflow</keyword><keyword>interannual variability</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>ocean data assimilation</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/J.Dynatmoce.2009.12.004</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., Awaji, T., Balmaseda, M., Ferry, N., Fujii, Y., Fukumori, I., … Weaver, A.

The main goals of the comparisons are to examine the consistency and evaluate the skill of different ODA products in simulating ITF transport. The ensemble averaged, time-mean value of ODA estimates is 13.6 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3)/s) for the common 1993-2001 period and 13.9 Sv for the 2004-2006 INSTANT Program period. These values are close to the 15-Sv estimate derived from INSTANT observations. All hut one ODA time-mean estimate fall within the range of uncertainty of the INSTANT estimate. In terms of temporal variability, the scatter among different ODA estimates averaged over time is 1.7 Sv, which is substantially smaller than the magnitude of the temporal variability simulated by the ODA systems. Therefore, the overall &quot;signal-to-noise&quot; ratio for the ensemble estimates is larger than one. The best consistency among the products occurs on seasonal-to-interannual time scales, with generally stronger (weaker) ITF during boreal summer (winter) and during La Nina (El Nino) events. The scatter among different products for seasonal-to-interannual time scales is approximately 1 Sv. Despite the good consistency, systematic difference is found between most ODA products and the INSTANT observations. All but the highest-resolution (18 km) ODA product show a dominant annual cycle while the INSTANT estimate and the 18-km product exhibit a strong semi-annual signal. The coarse resolution is an important factor that limits the level of agreement between ODA and INSTANT estimates. Decadal signals with periods of 10-15 years are seen. The most conspicuous and consistent decadal change is a relatively sharp increase in ITF transport during 1993-2000 associated with the strengthening tropical Pacific trade wind. Most products do not show a weakening ITF after the mid-1970s' associated with the weakened Pacific trade wind. The scatter of ODA estimates is smaller after than before 1980, reflecting the impact of the enhanced observations after the 1980s. To assess the representativeness of using the average over a three-year period (e.g., the span of the INSTANT Program) to describe longer-term mean, we investigate the temporal variations of the three-year low-pass ODA estimates. The average variation is about 3.6 Sv, which is largely due to the increase of ITF transport from 1993 to 2000. However, the three-year average during the 2004-2006 INSTANT Program period is within 0.5 Sv of the long-term mean for the past few decades. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Ice mechanics follow a viscous-plastic rheology and the ice momentum equations are solved numerically using either line-successive-over-relaxation (LSOR) or elastic–viscous-plastic (EVP) dynamic models. Ice thermodynamics are represented using either a zero-heat-capacity formulation or a two-layer formulation that conserves enthalpy. The model includes prognostic variables for snow thickness and for sea ice salinity. The above sea ice model components were borrowed from current generation climate models but they were reformulated on an Arakawa C grid in order to match the MITgcm oceanic grid and they were modified in many ways to permit efficient and accurate automatic differentiation. Both stress tensor divergence and advective terms are discretized with the finite-volume method. The choice of the dynamic solver has a considerable effect on the solution; this effect can be larger than, for example, the choice of lateral boundary conditions, of ice rheology, and of ice-ocean stress coupling. The solutions obtained with different dynamic solvers typically differ by a few cm s−1 in ice drift speeds, 50 cm in ice thickness, and order 200 km3 yr−1 in freshwater (ice and snow) export out of the Arctic.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoteit, I.</author><author>Cornuelle, B.</author><author>Heimbach, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An eddy-permitting, dynamically consistent adjoint-based assimilation system for the tropical Pacific: Hindcast experiments in 2000</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>C03001</pages><volume>115</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4DVAR</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>tropical Pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JC005437</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hoteit, I., B.

The system uses the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's general circulation model and its adjoint. The adjoint method is used to adjust the model to observations by controlling the initial temperature and salinity; temperature, salinity, and horizontal velocities at the open boundaries; and surface fluxes of momentum, heat, and freshwater. The model is constrained with most of the available data sets in the tropical Pacific, including Tropical Atmosphere and Ocean, ARGO, expendable bathythermograph, and satellite SST and sea surface height data, and climatologies. Results of hindcast experiments in 2000 suggest that the iterated adjoint-based descent is able to significantly improve the model consistency with the multivariate data sets, providing a dynamically consistent realization of the tropical Pacific circulation that generally matches the observations to within specified errors. The estimated model state is evaluated both by comparisons with observations and by checking the controls, the momentum balances, and the representation of small-scale features that were not well sampled by the observations used in the assimilation. As part of these checks, the estimated controls are smoothed and applied in independent model runs to check that small changes in the controls do not greatly change the model hindcast. This is a simple ensemble-based uncertainty analysis. In addition, the original and smoothed controls are applied to a version of the model with doubled horizontal resolution resulting in a broadly similar “downscaled” hindcast, showing that the adjustments are not tuned to a single configuration (meaning resolution, topography, and parameter settings). The time-evolving model state and the adjusted controls should be useful for analysis or to supply the forcing, initial, and boundary conditions for runs of other models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Song, Hajoon</author><author>Hoteit, Ibrahim</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce D.</author><author>Subramanian, Aneesh C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Adaptive Approach to Mitigate Background Covariance Limitations in the Ensemble Kalman Filter</title><secondary-title>Monthly Weather Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Monthly Weather Review</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>0027-0644</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2010MWR2871.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Song, H., Hoteit, I., Cornuelle, B.

The method enhances the representativeness of the EnKF ensemble by augmenting it with new members chosen adaptively to add missing information that prevents the EnKF fromfully fitting the data to the ensemble. The vectors to be added are obtained by back projecting the residuals of the observation misfits from the EnKF analysis step onto the state space. The back projection is done using an optimal interpolation (OI) scheme based on an estimated covariance of the subspace missing from the ensemble. In the experiments reported here, the OI uses a stationary background covariance matrix, as in the hybrid EnKF-three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) approach, but the resulting correction is included as a new ensemble member instead of being added to all existing ensemble members. The adaptive approach is tested with the Lorenz-96 model. The hybrid EnKF-3DVAR is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the adaptive approach. Assimilation experiments suggest that the new adaptive scheme significantly improves the EnKF behavior when it suffers from small size ensembles and neglected model errors. It was further found to be competitive with the hybrid EnKF-3DVAR approach, depending on ensemble size and data coverage.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ito, T.</author><author>Woloszyn, M.</author><author>Mazloff, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Anthropogenic carbon dioxide transport in the Southern Ocean driven by Ekman flow</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>0028-0836</isbn><accession-num>20054394</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature08687</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ito, T., Woloszyn, M., &amp;amp; Mazloff, M.

The coup led model was based on the MITgcm ocean circulation model and classical H ibler79 type two category thermodynam ics 2 dynam ics sea ice model. The sea ice dynam ics was considered based on Viscous 2 Plastic (VP) . The sea ice thermodynam ics was considered based on Winton three 2 lay 2 er models. A detailed configuration of coup led model has been introduced. Special attention has been paid to the model grid setup, subgrid paramerization, ice 2 ocean coup ling and open boundary treatm ent. The coup led model was then app lied and two test run examp les were p res 2 ented. The first model run was a clim atology sim ulation w ith ten years ( 1992 — 2002 ) averaged NCAR /NCEP reanalysis data as atm ospheric forcing. The second model run was a seasonal sim ulation for the period of 1992 — 2007. The atm ospheric forcing was daily NCAR /NCEP re 2 analysis. The clim atology sim ulation cap tured the general pattern of the sea ice thickness distri 2 bution of the A rctic, i. e. , the thickest sea ice is situated around the Canada A rchipelago and the north coast of the Greenland. For the second model run, the modeled Sep tember Sea ice extent anomaly from 1992 — 2007 was highly correlated w ith the observations, w ith a linear cor 2 relation coefficient of 0. 88. The m inim um of the A rctic sea ice area in the Sep tember of 2007 was unp recedented. The modeled sea ice area and extent for this m inim um was overestim ated relative to the observations.

The underlying geostrophic currents were estimated from the Jason-1 - TOPEX/Poseidon (JTP) tandem altimetric sea surface height (SSH) measurements using the “parallel-track-approach” with a 6.2 km along-track resolution. However, due to the given separation of the tracks of the two satellites, only large mesoscale eddies are resolved by the tandem measurements. The analysis covers the entire 3-year period of the tandem mission (109 repeat cycles) from September, 2002, to September, 2005. The high resolution along-track availability of the geostrophic velocity estimates allows for a spacial mapping of all quantities on a 2 ◦ × 1 ◦ grid, resulting in a doubled mapping resolution. The ocean circulation is shown to have a slightly higher meridional variability by 10 to 20 % in mid lat- itudes, while in the tropics the EKE field is dominated by the variability of the mostly zonal current field which clarifies that in some regions it can be important to assume anisotropy. Very complex structures emerge in the ratio of EKE and mean kinetic energy (MKE). How- ever, the ratio is shown to be a lower bound estimate. The investigation of the seasonal flow changes reveals annual variations of all major current systems, particularly of the zonal flow-field in low latitudes. There, they lead to zonal jet-like structures on the annual cycle in the southern Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean. In mid and high latitudes, indications of a seasonally modulated strength of the Sverdrup circulation emerge from the analysis. Noticeable in mid- and high latitudes are large changes in the wind-driven barotropic cir- culation that are not represented in other altimetric velocity products. The EKE field also shows changes in its amplitude on the annual period. In low latitudes, these can be explained by seasonally modulated currents. The strongest signals appear in the Gulf of Tehuantepec close to the Central American continent and in the Great Whirl region. On the annual period (as well as for the 3-year mean EKE), the Indian Ocean is the most energetic basin. The frequency and wavenumber spectra are shown for both geostrophic velocity components and for the EKE on global and regional scales. New insights are obtained due to the sepa- rate consideration of both velocity components such as a slightly higher energy level for the meridional component in the frequency range below 100 days over the entire extra-tropical ocean. Furthermore, strikingly universal frequency-slopes are found for all extra-tropical regions, thought containing different power spectral densities (PSD). On the aliasing fre- quencies of the M 2 and S 2 tides, peaks exist in some regions on the continental shelves that suggest an insufficient correction of the tidal signal from the FES2004 tidal model. For the wavenumber spectra, the resolution of the tandem mission becomes evident for wave- lengths shorter than 100 - 200 km. Nevertheless, new features appear for longer wavelengths such as the steeper slope for the zonal velocity component compared to the meridional. Be- sides the differences between the velocity components, nearly equal slopes are found within the wavenumber spectra of all extra-tropical regions (excluding the meridional component of the low energy regions). The slopes of the EKE wavenumber spectra indicate that the surface quasi geostrophic (SQG) turbulence theory is a better explanation than the quasi geostrophic (QG) theory for the satellite data.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mcguire, A.D.</author><author>Hayes, D.J.</author><author>Kicklighter, D.W.</author><author>Manizza, M.</author><author>Zhuang, Q.</author><author>Chen, M.</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Gurney, K.R.</author><author>Mcclelland, J.W.</author><author>Melillo, J.M.</author><author>Peterson, B.J.</author><author>Prinn, R.G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An analysis of the carbon balance of the Arctic Basin from 1997 to 2006</title><secondary-title>Tellus B: Chemical and Physical Meteorology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tellus B: Chemical and Physical Meteorology</full-title></periodical><pages>455-474</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1600-0889.2010.00497.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mcguire, A.

These environments are related to problems where multiple users and devices may interact, and where simple and local solutions could possibly generate good results, but may not be effective with regards to use and interaction. There are many techniques that can be employed to face this kind of problems, from CORBA to multi-agent systems, passing by web-services and SOA, among others. All those methodologies have their advantages and disadvantages that are properly analyzed in this documents, to finally explain the new architecture presented as a solution for distributed environment problems. The new architecture for solving complex solutions in distributed environments presented here is called OBaMADE: Organization Based Multiagent Architecture for Distributed Environments. It is a multiagent architecture based on the organizations of agents paradigm, where the agents in the architecture are structured into organizations to improve their organizational capabilities. The reasoning power of the architecture is based on the Case-Based Reasoning methology, being implemented in a internal organization that uses agents to create services to solve the external request made by the users. The OBaMADE architecture has been successfully applied to two different case studies where its prediction capabilities have been properly checked. Those case studies have showed optimistic results and, being complex systems, have demonstrated the abstraction and generalizations capabilities of the architecture. Nevertheless OBaMADE is intended to be able to solve much other kind of problems in distributed environments scenarios. It should be applied to other varieties of situations and to other knowledge fields to fully develop its potencial.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vondrák, Jan</author><author>Ron, Cyril</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Study of atmospheric and oceanic excitations in the motion of earth's spin axis in space</title><secondary-title>Acta Geodynamica et Geomaterialia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Geodynamica et Geomaterialia</full-title></periodical><pages>19-28</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Earth orientation</keyword><keyword>Geophysical excitation</keyword><keyword>Nutation</keyword><keyword>VLBI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><notes>Vondrák, J., &amp;amp; Ron, C.

Total SLV can be observed by radar altimetry satellites such as TOPEX/POSEIDON and Jason 1/2. The steric SLV can be computed through temperature and salinity profiles from in situ measurements or from ocean general circulation models (OGCM), which can assimilate the said observations. The mass-induced SLV can be estimated from its time-variable gravity (TVG) signals. We revisit this problem in the Mediterranean Sea estimating the observed, steric, and mass-induced SLV, for the latter we analyze the latest TVG data set from the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission launched in 2002, which is 3.5 times longer than in previous studies, with the application of a two-stage anisotropic filter to reduce the noise in high-degree and -order spherical harmonic coefficients. We confirm that the intra-annual total SLV are only produced by water mass changes, a fact explained in the literature as a result of the wind field around the Gibraltar Strait. The steric SLV estimated from the residual of &quot;altimetry minus GRACE&quot; agrees in phase with that estimated from OGCMs and in situ measurements, although showing a higher amplitude. The net water fluxes through both the straits of Gibraltar and Sicily have also been estimated accordingly.

Observations related to other model quantities are somewhat more limited but increasing as interest in high-latitude processes intensifies. Sea ice thickness, long judged a critical quantity in the physical system, is now being scrutinized more closely in sea ice model simulations as more expansive measurements become available. While albedo is often the first parameter chosen by modelers to adjust simulated ice thickness, this paper explores a set of less prominent parameters to which thickness is also quite sensitive. These include parameters associated with sea ice conductivity, mechanical redistribution, oceanic heat flux, and ice-ocean dynamic stress, in addition to shortwave radiation. Multiple combinations of parameter values can produce the same mean ice thickness using the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model, CICE. One of these &quot; tuned&quot; simulations is compared with a variety of observational data sets in both hemispheres. While deformed ice area compares well with the limited observations available for ridged ice, thickness measurements differ such that the model cannot agree with all of them simultaneously. Albedo and ice-ocean dynamic parameters that affect the turning of the ice relative to the ocean currents have the largest effect on ice thickness, of the parameters tested here. That is, sea ice thickness is highly sensitive to changes in external forcing by the atmosphere or ocean, and therefore serves as a sensitive diagnostic for high-latitude change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dobslaw, H.</author><author>Dill, R.</author><author>Grötzsch, A.</author><author>Brzeziński, Aleksander</author><author>Thomas, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal polar motion excitation from numerical models of atmosphere, ocean, and continental hydrosphere</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>B10406</pages><volume>115</volume><issue>B10</issue><keywords><keyword>Earth rotation variations.</keyword><keyword>Geodesy and Gravity: Earth rotation variations</keyword><keyword>Geodesy and Gravity: Mass balance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>0148-0227</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JB007127</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dobslaw, H., Dill, R., Grötzsch, A., Brzeziński, A., &amp;amp; Thomas, M.

Mass exchanges among the subsystems are realized by means of freshwater fluxes, causing the total ocean mass to vary predominantly annually. Variations in total ocean mass affect the oceanic excitations of the annual wobble by almost 1 milliarc second (mas) for both prograde and retrograde components, whereas the motion term contributions of terrestrial water flow derived from LSDM are found to be 3 orders of magnitude smaller. Since differences to geodetic excitations are not substantially reduced and regional decompositions demonstrate the large spatial variability of contributions to seasonal polar motion excitation that compensate each other when integrated globally, it is concluded that the closure of the seasonal excitation budget is still inhibited by remaining model errors in all subsystems.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kroner, C</author><author>Thomas, M</author><author>Dobslaw, H</author><author>Abe, M</author><author>Weise, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal effects of non-tidal oceanic mass shifts in observations with superconducting gravimeters</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>354-359</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>3-5</issue><keywords><keyword>GRACE validation</keyword><keyword>Long-periodic gravity variations</keyword><keyword>Ocean models</keyword><keyword>Superconducting gravimetry</keyword><keyword>atmospheric-pressure</keyword><keyword>earth</keyword><keyword>field</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>ground gravity measurements</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>parameters</keyword><keyword>reduction</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword><keyword>validation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jog.2009.09.009</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kroner, C., M.

At the same time evidence needs to be provided that these reductions are both necessary and sufficient. Based on the OMCT and the ECCO model the gravity effect of non-tidal oceanic mass shifts is computed for various sites equipped with a superconducting gravimeter (SG) and esp. the long-periodic contributions are studied. With these oceanic models the dynamic ocean response to atmospheric pressure loading is automatically computed, and thus goes beyond the more simplistic concepts of an inverted barometer, or alternately a rigid ocean, which is a clear advantage. The findings so far are ambiguous: for instance the systematic seasonal change of about 10 nm/s(2) in gravity for mid-European stations is presently not found in the observed gravity variations. Generally, the order of magnitude of the total effect of 22-27 nm/s(2) is surprisingly large for inland stations. in some data sections the reduction leads to the removal of some of the larger residuals. The results obtained for the South-African station Sutherland differ. Here the modelled seasonal variation caused by the non-tidal oceanic mass redistribution and gravity residuals generally correlate, and thus by the reduction an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio in the gravity observations is achieved. An explanation for the different results might be found in the global hydrological models. Such a model is needed in order to remove the effect of large-scale variations in continental water storage in the gravity observations. This reduction plays a greater role for European stations than for the South African site. A critical impact of the land-sea-mask used in the oceanic models and the subsequent insufficient resolution of the North and Baltic Sea on the computations at the mid-European sites could not be confirmed. From a comparison between the OMCT and the ECCO model substantial discrepancies in some regions of the earth emerge, while both predict variations at inland stations in Europe, South Africa, and Asia of similar magnitude. We currently hesitate to recommend including this reduction in the routine processing of SG data because the seasonal order of magnitude for inland stations is unexpectedly large and partly significant deviations between the modelled oceanic effects exist. if the order of magnitude proves to be correct universally, this reduction has to be applied.

The divergence of the transformation rate yields the rate at which a given temperature range is created or destroyed by air–sea heat fluxes (formation). Walin’s framework provides a precise integral statement at the expense of losing spatial information. In this study the integrand of Walin’s expression to yield transformation and formation maps is plotted and used to study the role of air–sea heat fluxes in the cycle of formation–destruction of the 18° ± 1°C layer in the North Atlantic. Using remotely sensed sea surface temperatures and air–sea heat flux estimates based on both analyzed meteorological fields and ocean data–model syntheses for the 3-yr period from 2004 to 2006, the authors find that Eighteen Degree Water (EDW) is formed by air–sea heat fluxes in the western part of the subtropical gyre, just south of the Gulf Stream. The formation rate peaks in February when the EDW layer is thickened by convection owing to buoyancy loss. EDW is destroyed by air–sea heat fluxes from spring to summer over the entire subtropical gyre. In the annual mean there is net EDW formation in the west to the south of the Gulf Stream, and net destruction over the eastern part of the gyre. Results suggest that annual mean formation rates of EDW associated with air–sea fluxes are in the range from 3 to 5 Sv (Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1). Finally, error estimates are computed from sea surface temperature and heat flux data using an ensemble perturbation method. The transformation/formation patterns are found to be robust and errors mostly affect integral quantities.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Condron, Alan</author><author>Winsor, Peter</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulated Response of the Arctic Freshwater Budget to Extreme NAO Wind Forcing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>2422-2437</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>Forcing</keyword><keyword>Freshwater</keyword><keyword>North Atlantic Oscillati</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2008JCLI2626.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Condron, A., Winsor, P., Hill, C., &amp;amp; Menemenlis, D.

At 1/6° (∼18 km) resolution the model resolves the major Arctic transport pathways, including Bering Strait and the Canadian Archipelago. Two main calculations are performed by repeating the wind fields of two contrasting NAO years in each run for the extreme negative and positive NAO phases of 1969 and 1989, respectively. These calculations are compared both with a control run and the compiled observationally based freshwater budget estimate of Serreze et al. The results show a clear response in the Arctic freshwater budget to NAO forcing, that is, repeat NAO negative wind forcing results in virtually all freshwater being retained in the Arctic, with the bulk of the freshwater content being pooled in the Beaufort gyre. In contrast, repeat NAO positive forcing accelerates the export of freshwater out of the Arctic to the North Atlantic, primarily via Fram Strait (∼900 km3 yr−1) and the Canadian Archipelago (∼500 km3 yr−1), with a total loss in freshwater storage of ∼13 000 km3 (15%) after 10 yr. The large increase in freshwater export through the Canadian Archipelago highlights the important role that this gateway plays in redistributing the freshwater of the Arctic to subpolar seas, by providing a direct pathway from the Arctic basin to the Labrador Sea, Gulf Stream system, and Atlantic Ocean. The authors discuss the sensitivity of the Arctic Ocean to long-term fixed extreme NAO states and show that the freshwater content of the Arctic is able to be restored to initial values from a depleted freshwater state after ∼20 yr.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manizza, M</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>McClelland, J W</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Hill, C N</author><author>Townsend-Small, A</author><author>Peterson, B J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling transport and fate of riverine dissolved organic carbon in the Arctic Ocean</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>4808 Chemical tracers</keyword><keyword>Arctic Ocean</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>biogeochemical processes</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008GB003396</electronic-resource-num><notes>Manizza, M., Follows, M.

Numerical models of the circulation and biogeochemical cycles of the region can help to interpret and extrapolate the data and may ultimately be applied in global change sensitivity studies. Here we develop and explore a regional, three-dimensional model of the Arctic Ocean in which, for the first time, we explicitly represent the sources of riverine DOC with seasonal discharge based on climatological field estimates. Through a suite of numerical experiments, we explore the distribution of DOC-like tracers with realistic riverine sources and a simple linear decay to represent remineralization through microbial degradation. The model reproduces the slope of the DOC-salinity relationship observed in the eastern and western Arctic basins when the DOC tracer lifetime is about 10 years, consistent with published inferences from field data. The new empirical parameterization of riverine DOC and the regional circulation and biogeochemical model provide new tools for application in both regional and global change studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Ponte, Rui</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Global General Circulation of the Ocean Estimated by the ECCO-Consortium</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>88-103</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>construction</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>sensitivity</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>variational data assimilation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2009.41</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., Heimbach, P., Ponte, R., &amp;amp; Fukumori, I.

We examine spatial inhomogeneity of the SETIO MLT budget, contrasting three subregions with different forcing/circulation characteristics to better understand the area mean budget over the full SETIO. The subregions are the equatorial zone (box 1), the Sumatra-Java upwelling zone (box 2), and east of the thermocline ridge (box 3). Seasonally, surface heat flux dominates MLT in all regions; advection and subsurface processes generally play secondary roles. On interannual scales, surface heat flux makes major contributions in all three boxes to termination of SETIO cooling associated with the Indian Ocean Zonal/Dipole Mode. Ocean dynamics show vital differences between regions: Subsurface processes cool box 1 and 2 but warm box 3. Horizontal advection warms box 1 but cools box 2 and 3. Averaging the MLT budget over the SETIO obscures regional physics. We explain spatial variations of the SETIO MLT budget in terms of differences in forcing, circulation, MLT distribution, and mixed layer and barrier layer thicknesses. We also examine SETIO MLT budget differences during 1994, 1997, and 2006, years exhibiting notable SETIO cooling events. In box 1, horizontal advection dominates warming after the 1994 and 2006 coolings, while in 1997, surface heat flux dominates warming. In box 2, cooling peaks earlier in 1994 than in 1997 and 2006 because of subsurface processes. Last, we show that the MLT budget is very different from heat budgets for fixed depth layers (e.g., the top 50–60 m).</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Douglass, Elizabeth</author><author>Roemmich, Dean</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Data Sensitivity of the ECCO State Estimate in a Regional Setting</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>2420-2443</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Databases</keyword><keyword>Model errors</keyword><keyword>Ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity studies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>doi:10.1175/2009JTECHO641.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Douglass, E., D.

In this study, the sensitivity of the solution to the constraints provided by various datasets is investigated in a regional setting in the North Pacific. Four assimilation experiments are performed, which vary by the data used as constraints and the relative weights associated with these data. The resulting estimates are compared to two of the assimilated datasets as well as to data from two time series stations not used as constraints. These comparisons demonstrate that increasing the weights of the subsurface data provides overall improvement in the model–data consistency of the estimate of the state of the North Pacific Ocean. However, some elements of the solution are degraded. This could result from incompatibility between datasets, possibly because of hidden biases, or from errors in the model physics made more evident by the increased weight on subsurface data. The adjustments to the control parameters of surface forcing and initial conditions necessary to obtain the more accurate fit to the data are found to be within prior error bars.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Bragg, J G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling the coupling of ocean ecology and biogeochemistry</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4815 Ecosystems</keyword><keyword>4858 Population dynamics and ecology</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>and modeling</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>ecology</keyword><keyword>ocean biogeochemistry</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword><keyword>resource competition</keyword><keyword>structure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008GB003405</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dutkiewicz, S., M.

We consider the complex model solutions in the light of resource competition theory. The emergent community structures and ecological regimes vary across different physical environments in the model ocean: Strongly seasonal, high-nutrient regions are dominated by fast growing bloom specialists, while stable, low-seasonality regions are dominated by organisms that can grow at low nutrient concentrations and are suited to oligotrophic conditions. In the latter regions, the framework of resource competition theory provides a useful qualitative and quantitative diagnostic tool with which to interpret the outcome of competition between model organisms, their regulation of the resource environment, and the sensitivity of the system to changes in key physiological characteristics of the cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, A T</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Kwok, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved modeling of the Arctic halocline with a subgrid-scale brine rejection parameterization</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>114</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4536 Hydrography and tracers</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>9315 Arctic region</keyword><keyword>brine rejection</keyword><keyword>halocline</keyword><keyword>model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC005121</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nguyen, A.

Modeling the halocline, however, remains a challenge in current state-of-the-art coupled ocean sea ice models including those that participated in the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project. In this study, we successfully reproduce a cold halocline in the Canada Basin by implementing a subgrid-scale brine rejection parameterization in an ocean general circulation model. The brine rejection scheme improves the solution by redistributing surface salts rejected during sea ice formation to their neutral buoyancy depths. The depths are based on salt plume physics and published laboratory and numerical experiments. Compared with hydrographic data from 1993 to 2004, distribution of most of the rejected salt to the bottom of the mixed layer seems to yield the lowest model-data misfits. We also show that the model's mixed layer depth is sensitive to the background diffusivity ν used in the k-profile parameterization vertical mixing scheme. A background diffusivity of 10−6 m2/s in combination with brine rejection scheme described herein yield the best simulation of the Arctic halocline.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baehr, J</author><author>Cunnningham, S</author><author>Haak, H</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Kanzow, T</author><author>Marotzke, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observed and simulated estimates of the meridional overturning circulation at 26.5-deg N in the Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Ocean Sci.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Sci.</full-title></periodical><pages>575-589</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Copernicus Publications</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/os-5-575-2009</electronic-resource-num><notes>Baehr, J., S.

The South Pacific origin of the 13 degrees C Water is also related to the formation of the Eastern Subtropical Mode Water (ESTMW) and the Sub-Antarctic Mode Water (SAMW). The portion of the ESTMW and SAMW that eventually enters the density range of the 13 degrees C Water (25.8 &lt; sigma(theta) &lt; 26.6 kg m(-3)) does so largely by mixing. Water formed in the subtropics enters the equatorial region predominantly through the western boundary, while its interior transport is relatively small. The fresher North Pacific ESTMW and Central Mode Water (CMW) are also important sources of the 13 degrees C Water. The ratio of the southern versus the northern origins of the water mass is about 2 to 1 and tends to increase with time elapsed from its origin. Of the total volume of initially tracer-tagged water in the eastern equatorial Pacific, approximately 47.5% originates from depths above sigma(theta) = 25.8 kg m(-3) and 34.6% from depths below sigma(theta) = 26.6 kg m(-3), indicative of a dramatic impact of mixing on the route of subtropical water to becoming the 13 degrees C Water. Still only a small portion of the water formed in the subtropics reaches the equatorial region, because most of the water is trapped and recirculates in the subtropical gyre.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Werf, Petra M.</author><author>Schouten, M W</author><author>van Leeuwen, P J</author><author>Ridderinkhof, H</author><author>de Ruijter, W P M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observation and origin of an interannual salinity anomaly in the Mozambique Channel</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>114</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>4223 Descriptive and regional oceanography</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4572 Upper ocean and mixed layer processes</keyword><keyword>Mozambique Channel</keyword><keyword>interannual variability</keyword><keyword>salinity anomaly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC004911</electronic-resource-num><notes>van der Werf, P.

Meanwhile, a moored array is continued from 2003 to 2008. This anomaly was most distinct showing an interannual but nonseasonal variation. The possible origin of the anomaly is investigated using output from three ocean general circulation models (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modeling, and Parallel Ocean Program). The most probable mechanism for the salinity anomaly is the anomalous inflow of subtropical waters caused by a weakening of the northern part of the South Equatorial Current by weaker trade winds. This mechanism was found in all three numerical models. In addition, the numerical models indicate a possible salinization of one of the source water masses to the Mozambique Channel as an additional cause of the anomaly. The anomaly propagated southward into the Agulhas Current and northward along the African coast.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Bugnion, Véronique</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Greenland ice-sheet volume sensitivity to basal, surface and initial conditions derived from an adjoint model</title><secondary-title>Annals of Glaciology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Glaciology</full-title></periodical><pages>67-80</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>52</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3189/172756409789624256</electronic-resource-num><notes>Heimbach, P., and V.

Lagrange multipliers, i.e. sensitivities, are computed with an exact, efficient adjoint model that has been generated from SICOPOLIS by rigorous application of automatic differentiation. The case study uses the adjoint model to determine the sensitivity of the total Greenland ice volume to various control variables over a 100 year period. The control space has of the order 1.2 × 10&lt;sup xmlns=&quot;http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/&quot;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; elements, consisting of spatial fields of basal flow parameters, surface and basal forcings and initial conditions. Reliability of the adjoint model was tested through finite-difference perturbation calculations for various control variables and perturbation regions, ascertaining quantitative inferences of the adjoint model. As well as confirming qualitative aspects of ice-sheet sensitivities (e.g. expected regional variations), we detect regions where model sensitivities are seemingly unexpected or counter-intuitive, albeit 'real' in the sense of actual model behavior. An example is inferred regions where sensitivities of ice-sheet volume to basal sliding coefficient are positive, i.e. where a local increase in basal sliding parameter &lt;i xmlns=&quot;http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/&quot;&gt;increases&lt;/i&gt; the ice-sheet volume. Similarly, positive (generally negative) ice temperature sensitivities in certain parts of the ice sheet are found, the detection of which seems highly unlikely if only conventional perturbation experiments had been used. The object of this paper is largely a proof of concept. Available adjoint-code generation tools now open up a variety of novel model applications, notably with regard to sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and ice-sheet state estimation or data assimilation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Utke, Jean</author><author>Hascoet, Laurent</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Hovland, Paul</author><author>Naumann, Uwe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toward adjoinable MPI</title><secondary-title>2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel &amp; Distributed Processing</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><keywords><keyword>Computer languages</keyword><keyword>Computer science</keyword><keyword>Cost function</keyword><keyword>Finite difference methods</keyword><keyword>Input variables</keyword><keyword>Laboratories</keyword><keyword>MPI</keyword><keyword>MPI-aware program analysis</keyword><keyword>Numerical models</keyword><keyword>Productivity</keyword><keyword>Protection switching</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity analysis</keyword><keyword>adjoinable MPI</keyword><keyword>application program interfaces</keyword><keyword>automatic differentiation</keyword><keyword>computer program</keyword><keyword>data flow computing</keyword><keyword>message passing</keyword><keyword>parallel communication dataflow</keyword><keyword>productivity tool</keyword><keyword>program diagnostics</keyword><keyword>reverse mode</keyword><keyword>source transformation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>978-1-4244-3751-1</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161165</electronic-resource-num><notes>Utke, J., L.

Therefore, it is an essential productivity tool in numerous computational science and engineering domains. Computing gradients with the adjoint (also called reverse) mode via source transformation is a particularly beneficial but also challenging use of automatic differentiation. To date only ad hoc solutions for adjoint differentiation of MPI programs have been available, forcing automatic differentiation tool users to reason about parallel communication dataflow and dependencies and manually develop adjoint communication code. Using the communication graph as a model we characterize the principal problems of adjoining the most frequently used communication idioms. We propose solutions to cover these idioms and consider the consequences for the MPI implementation, the MPI user and MPI-aware program analysis. The MIT general circulation model serves as a use case to illustrate the viability of our approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Worcester, P F</author><author>Munk, W H</author><author>Spindel, R C</author><author>Mercer, J A</author><author>Howe, B M</author><author>Metzger, K</author><author>Birdsall, T G</author><author>Andrew, R K</author><author>Dzieciuch, M A</author><author>Cornuelle, B D</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A decade of acoustic thermometry in the North Pacific Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>C07021</pages><volume>114</volume><issue>C7</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4259 Ocean acoustics</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4263 Ocean predictability and prediction</keyword><keyword>acoustic thermometry</keyword><keyword>basin-scale variability</keyword><keyword>model testing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC005124</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dushaw, B.

The acoustic travel times are inherently spatially integrating, which suppresses mesoscale variability and provides a precise measure of ray-averaged temperature. Daily average travel times at 4-day intervals provide excellent temporal resolution of the large-scale thermal field. The interannual, seasonal, and shorter-period variability is large, with substantial changes sometimes occurring in only a few weeks. Linear trends estimated over the decade are small compared to the interannual variability and inconsistent from path to path, with some acoustic paths warming slightly and others cooling slightly. The measured travel times are compared with travel times derived from four independent estimates of the North Pacific: (1) climatology, as represented by the World Ocean Atlas 2005 (WOA05); (2) objective analysis of the upper-ocean temperature field derived from satellite altimetry and in situ profiles; (3) an analysis provided by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean project, as implemented at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL-ECCO); and (4) simulation results from a high-resolution configuration of the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) model. The acoustic data show that WOA05 is a better estimate of the time mean hydrography than either the JPL-ECCO or the POP estimates, both of which proved incapable of reproducing the observed acoustic arrival patterns. The comparisons of time series provide a stringent test of the large-scale temperature variability in the models. The differences are sometimes substantial, indicating that acoustic thermometry data can provide significant additional constraints for numerical ocean models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gruber, Nicolas</author><author>Gloor, Manuel</author><author>Mikaloff Fletcher, Sara E</author><author>Doney, Scott C</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Gerber, Markus</author><author>Jacobson, Andrew R</author><author>Joos, Fortunat</author><author>Lindsay, Keith</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mouchet, Anne</author><author>Müller, Simon A</author><author>Sarmiento, Jorge L</author><author>Takahashi, Taro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic sources, sinks, and transport of atmospheric CO2</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>23</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>0414 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>0428 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>0460 Marine systems</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>air-sea carbon flux</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>anthropogenic CO2</keyword><keyword>carbon flux</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008GB003349</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gruber, N., and Coauthors, 2009: Oceanic sources, sinks, and transport of atmospheric CO2.

These two independent flux estimates reveal a consistent description of the regional distribution of annual mean sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2 for the decade of the 1990s and the early 2000s with differences at the regional level of generally less than 0.1 Pg C a−1. This distribution is characterized by outgassing in the tropics, uptake in midlatitudes, and comparatively small fluxes in thehigh latitudes. Both estimates point toward a small (∼ −0.3 Pg C a−1) contemporary CO2 sink in the Southern Ocean (south of 44°S), a result of the near cancellation between a substantial outgassing of natural CO2 and a strong uptake of anthropogenic CO2. A notable exception in the generally good agreement between the two estimates exists within the Southern Ocean: the ocean inversion suggests a relatively uniform uptake, while the pCO2-based estimate suggests strong uptake in the region between 58°S and 44°S, and a source in the region south of 58°S. Globally and for a nominal period between 1995 and 2000, the contemporary net air-sea flux of CO2 is estimated to be −1.7 ± 0.4 Pg C a−1 (inversion) and −1.4 ± 0.7 Pg C a−1 (pCO2-climatology), respectively, consisting of an outgassing flux of river-derived carbon of ∼+0.5 Pg C a−1, and an uptake flux of anthropogenic carbon of −2.2 ± 0.3 Pg C a−1 (inversion) and −1.9 ± 0.7 Pg C a−1 (pCO2-climatology). The two flux estimates also imply a consistent description of the contemporary meridional transport of carbon with southward ocean transport throughout most of the Atlantic basin, and strong equatorward convergence in the Indo-Pacific basins. Both transport estimates suggest a small hemispheric asymmetry with a southward transport of between −0.2 and −0.3 Pg C a−1 across the equator. While the convergence of these two independent estimates is encouraging and suggests that it is now possible to provide relatively tight constraints for the net air-sea CO2 fluxes at the regional basis, both studies are limited by their lack of consideration of long-term changes in the ocean carbon cycle, such as the recent possible stalling in the expected growth of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sannino, G</author><author>Herrmann, M</author><author>Carillo, A</author><author>Rupolo, V</author><author>Ruggiero, V</author><author>Artale, V</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An eddy-permitting model of the Mediterranean Sea with a two-way grid refinement at the Strait of Gibraltar</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>56-72</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Mediterranean ocean model</keyword><keyword>Strait of Gibraltar</keyword><keyword>Two-way grid refinement</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2009.06.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sannino, G., M.

Within this grid a 1 24 ° resolution model of the Strait of Gibraltar is embedded. The two grids belong to different models that are coupled through an external parallel driver. The robustness of the adopted grid refinement procedure is tested on a multi-decadal integration simulating the present climate. The good agreement found between the model circulation and most of the available observations confirms both the robustness and effectiveness of the two-way grid refinement technique. The effects produced on the Mediterranean circulation by the grid refinement are investigated through the comparison of two simulations differing only in the presence of the grid refinement. Even though the main characteristics of the thermohaline circulation appear similar in the two simulations, some quantitative and qualitative differences are observed: the main differences found in the Strait of Gibraltar propagate into the whole basin, have an impact on the water column stratification, and consequently on the convection events.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferrari, Raffaele</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Circulation Kinetic Energy: Reservoirs, Sources, and Sinks</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics</full-title></periodical><pages>253-282</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>energy spectrum,geostrophic eddies,internal waves,</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev.fluid.40.111406.102139</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ferrari, R., and C.

Although the wind field produces a large energy input to the ocean, all but approximately 10% appears to be dissipated within about 100 m of the sea surface, rendering observations of the energy divergence necessary to maintain the full water-column flow difficult. Attention thus shifts to the physically different kinetic energy (KE) reservoirs of the circulation and their maintenance, dissipation, and possible influence on the very small scales representing irreversible molecular mixing. Oceanic KE is dominated by the geostrophic eddy field, and depending on the vertical structure (barotropic versus low-mode baroclinic), direct and inverse energy cascades are possible. The pathways toward dissipation of the dominant geostrophic eddy KE depend crucially on the direction of the cascade but are difficult to quantify because of serious observational difficulties for wavelengths shorter than approximately 100–200 km. At high frequencies, KE is dominated by internal waves with near-inertial frequencies (frequencies near the local Coriolis parameter), whose shears appear to be a major source of wave breaking and mixing in the ocean interior.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Quinn, Katherine J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bottom pressure changes around Antarctica and wind-driven meridional flows</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>36</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>1217 Time variable gravity</keyword><keyword>1222 Ocean monitoring with geodetic techniques</keyword><keyword>4207 Arctic and Antarctic oceanography</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>Ekman transport</keyword><keyword>Southern Ocean</keyword><keyword>bottom pressure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009GL039060</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

Both GRACE and ECCO results indicate mass exchange primarily between the Southern Ocean and the Pacific and the importance of zonal wind stress to this exchange. The ECCO flow fields show that the near-surface meridional Ekman transport, directly driven by the zonal wind stress, is nearly balanced by return flows below the shallowest topography at 60°S (∼1300 m at this Drake Passage latitude), with the return transport being slightly lagged in time relative to the Ekman transport. Such time lags, which may result from geostrophic adjustment at depth, cause the small associated net transport across 60°S to be ∼90° out of phase with the wind. This in turn can explain why zonal wind stress and bottom pressure anomalies around Antarctica tend to be anticorrelated in both GRACE and ECCO results.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Global Zonally Integrated Ocean Circulation, 1992–2006: Seasonal and Decadal Variability</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>351-368</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Ocean circulation,Seasonal cycle,Seasonal cycle,Tr</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2008JPO4012.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., and P.

A variety of simple theories all produce time scales suggesting that the mid- and high-latitude oceans should respond to atmospheric driving only over several decades. In practice, little change is seen in the MOC and associated heat transport except very close to the sea surface, at depth near the equator, and in parts of the Southern Ocean. Variability in meridional transports in both volume and enthalpy is dominated by the annual cycle and secondarily by the semiannual cycle, particularly in the Southern Ocean. On time scales longer than a year, the solution exhibits small trends with complicated global spatial patterns. Apart from a net uptake of heat from the atmosphere (forced by the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis, which produces net ocean heating), the origins of the meridional transport trends are not distinguishable and are likely a combination of model disequilibrium, shifts in the observing system, other trends (real or artificial) in the meteorological fields, and/or true oceanic secularities. None of the results, however, supports an inference of oceanic circulation shifts taking the system out of the range in which changes are more than small perturbations. That the oceanic observations do not conflict with an apparent excess heat uptake from the atmosphere implies a continued undersampling of the global ocean, even in the upper layers.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoteit, I.</author><author>Cornuelle, B.</author><author>Kim, S.Y.</author><author>Forget, G.</author><author>Köhl, A.</author><author>Terrill, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing 4D-VAR for dynamical mapping of coastal high-frequency radar in San Diego</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>175-197</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>1-3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2008.11.005</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hoteit, I., Cornuelle, B., Kim, S.

The Regional Ocean Modeling System was modified to simulate the thermodynamic processes beneath ice shelves, including direct basal processes and frazil ice dynamics. Process-orientated studies of simplified ice-shelf-ocean cavities investigate the sensitivity of the melting/freezing to the various parametrisations which describe the internal physics of the models. The Amery Ice Shelf/ocean model is forced with tides, seasonal winds and relaxation to seasonal lateral boundary climatologies. The open ocean surface fluxes are modified by an imposed climatological sea-ice cover that includes the seasonal effect of polynyas. The circulation and basal melting and freezing show good agreement with glaciological and oceanographic observations that have been collected from beneath the Amery Ice Shelf via boreholes through the ice and in the adjacent area of Prydz Bay. Strong horizontal and thermohaline (&quot;ice-pump&quot;) circulation is primarily driven by melting and refreezing of the ice shelf. The net basal melt rate is — 45 Gt year (— 0.7 m year -1 ), which represents 67 % of the total mass loss of the Amery Ice Shelf. The total amount of refreezing is — 5.3 Gt year -1 , of which 70 % is due to frazil accretion. The seasonal variability of the basal melt/freeze (up to ±1 m year -1 ) within 100 km of the open ocean is the same magnitude as the area-averaged melt rates. The annual averaged bottom water formation rates are r-1.2 Sv to the west of the Amery, in the vicinity of Cape Darnley. The Amery Ice Shelf/ocean model is used to investigate the sensitivity of the basal melt/freeze and bottom water formation to the inclusion of various physical mechanisms and changes in forcing. Direct comparison with glaciological observations shows that ice-shelf models that include frazil processes improve the simulated pattern of marine ice accretion. Simulations without ice-shelf/ocean thermodynamic processes overestimate bottom water formation by up to 2.8 times as much as simulations with ice-shelf/ocean thermodynamic processes, due to the missing buoyant freshwater from the melting ice shelf. Climate change sensitivity studies suggest that an ocean warming of 1°C above present day temperatures can potentially remove the Amery Ice Shelf in —500 years, solely due to increased basal melting, and can also lead to a significant decrease in the formation of bottom water. This research contributes to understanding how interaction between ice shelves and various forcing mechanisms can lead to changes in basal melt/freeze and dense water formation, which has major implications for the stability of ice shelves, sea level rise, and the salt budget of the global oceans.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mata, Aitor</author><author>Corchado, Juan Manuel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forecasting the probability of finding oil slicks using a CBR system</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>8239-8246</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2008.10.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mata, A., &amp;amp; Corchado, J.

Traditional carotid endoarterectomy (CEA) is the most performed surgical treatment for carotid stenosis. In symptomatic patients CEA reduces significantly absolute relative risk of stroke and death. In asymptomatic patients AHA guidelines recommend CEA for stenosis 60-99%, if the risk of peri-operative stroke or death is &lt;3%. According to 2007 Clinical Expert Consensus Document Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS) should be used in patients at high-risk for CEA or into controlled trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews does not support a widespread change in clinical practice away from recommending CEA as the treatment of choice for suitable carotid artery stenosis. Methods: Large series about CEA, published in the last years, show a trend about a sensible reduction of neurologic complications or death, even below one percent. Several studies have been addressed to evaluate relative role of CEA and CAS. In carotid occlusive disease treatment SPACE and EVA-3S failed to demonstrate superiority of CAS vs. CEA. More studies are still enrolling patients but some of them, as WALLSTENT, SAPPHIRE, SPACE and EVA-3S, have been stopped for excessive complication rate in the CAS limb independently from patient subset and EDP stent. Results: Although the impact on stroke remains unestablished, results are consistent with a clinically important increase in stroke risk with CAS, an intervention that aims at reducing the risk of stroke 2 In a recent review of 32 studies comprising CAS and CEA, the incidence of any new Diffusion-Weighted Imaging lesion was significantly higher after CAS (37%) than after CEA (10%). After two years' follow-up SPACE trial showed as the rate of recurrent ipsilateral ischaemic strokes is similar for both treatment groups and the incidence of recurrent carotid stenosis is significantly higher after CAS. EVA 3S after four years' follow-up showed that cumulative probability of periprocedural stroke or death and non-procedural ipsilateral stroke was higher with CAS. After the periprocedural period, the risk of ipsilateral stroke was low and similar in both treatment groups. Open question regarding CEA still exist in particular about shunt, technique and anaesthesia. Conclusions: Today CEA is the best treatment until uncontroindicated. Current data, Cochrane and AHA support CAS procedures for TRIALS enrollment or for CEA contraindications. Indications both CEA or CAS should have the same criteria. For asymptomatic patients still remain debate in the choice of CEA, CAS or best medical treatment.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mata, Aitor</author><author>Tapia, Dante I</author><author>González, Angélica</author><author>Pérez, Belén</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Springer-Verlag</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>A Contingency Response Multi-agent System for Oil Spills</title><secondary-title>7th International Conference on PAAMS'09</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>7th International Conference on PAAMS'09</full-title></periodical><pages>274-283</pages><keywords><keyword>case-based reasoning</keyword><keyword>distributed architectures</keyword><keyword>multi-agent systems</keyword><keyword>oil spill</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><pub-location>Berlin, Heidelberg</pub-location><isbn>9783642004865</isbn><notes>Mata, A., Tapia, D.

The system makes use of a Case-Based Reasoning system which generates predic- tions to determine the probability of finding oil slicks in certain areas of the ocean. CBR uses past information to generate new solutions to the current problem. The system employs a distri- buted multi-agent architecture so that the main components of the system can be accessed remotely. Therefore, all functionalities can communicate in a distributed way, even from mo- bile devices. The core of the system is a group of deliberative agents acting as controllers and administrators for all functionalities. The system has been used to predict real oil spill situa- tions. Results have demonstrated that the system can accurately predict the presence of oil slicks in determined zones. It has been demonstrated that using a distributed architecture can enhance the overall performance of the system.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pattern and velocity of propagation of the global ocean eddy variability</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>C11017</pages><volume>114</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>4512 Currents</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4562 Topographic/bathymetric interactions</keyword><keyword>ocean eddy</keyword><keyword>propagation velocity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JC005349</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fu, L.-L.

Decade-long time series of sea surface height is analyzed for finding the maximum cross correlation with neighboring time series within a window of space and time lags. The space and time lags corresponding to the maximum correlation allow an estimate of the propagation velocity of the eddy variability that dominates the variance of sea surface height anomalies. The method cannot distinguish the various forms of eddy variability: isolated eddies and fronts, the meandering of ocean currents, or planetary waves. However, the results provide, at a given location of the global oceans, a uniquely determined propagation velocity that represents a time-averaged description of the tendency of the movement of the local eddy variability. The propagation velocity is highly inhomogeneous in space. Outside the equatorial zone, the zonal propagation is intrinsically westward, modified by ocean currents, which could reverse the zonal propagation to eastward in regions like the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. At midlatitudes and high latitudes, the propagation pattern is highly affected by the path of ocean currents and the shape of bottom topography. At tropical latitudes, the meridional propagation is convergent toward the equator in the western basins and divergent away from the equator in the eastern basins. Comparison with the simulations of an eddy-permitting ocean general circulation model shows overall agreement, especially in the latitudinal variation of the zonal propagation velocity. The result suggests that the model has captured the essence of the dynamics governing the propagation of ocean eddy variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cummings, James</author><author>Bertino, Laurent</author><author>Brasseur, Pierre</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Kamachi, Masafumi</author><author>Martin, Matthew J</author><author>Mogensen, Kristian</author><author>Oke, Peter</author><author>Testut, Charles E</author><author>Verron, Jacques</author><author>Weaver, Anthony</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean Data Assimilation Systems for GODAE</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>96-109</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>kalman filter</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>salinity</keyword><keyword>smoother</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2009.69</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cummings, J., and Coauthors, 2009: Ocean Data Assimilation Systems for Godae.

Approaches to ocean data assimilation vary widely both in terms of the sophistication of the method and the observations assimilated, and also in terms of specification of the forecast error covariances, model biases, observation errors, and quality-control procedures. In this paper, we describe some of the ocean data assimilation systems that have been developed within the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) community. We discuss assimilation methods, observations assimilated, and techniques used to specify error covariances. In addition, we describe practical implementation aspects and present analysis performance results for some of the analysis systems. Finally, we describe plans for improving the assimilation systems in the post-GODAE time period beyond 2008.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van der Werf, Petra M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of the Mozambique Channel Throughflow</title></titles><periodical/><pages>147</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><notes>van der Werf, P.

In this dissertation, we study the variability of the Mozambique Channel throughflow in the range from eddy to interannual time scales and investigate the origin of this variability. A 4.2-year time series obtained by a mooring array in the Mozambique Channel at 17S was the main object of study, together with output from (Ocean General Circulation) models and satellite observations. Over the length of the observational time series, the mean volume transport 16.7 Sv southward, with daily values ranging between 45 Sv northward and 65 Sv southward. The throughflow is highly variable on a large range of time scales. Interannual variability was observed both in the volume transport and subsurface salinity in the Mozambique Channel. The amplitude of these variations was large, in the order of 9 Sv for the transport time series and about 0.2 PSU for a salinity anomaly. The interannual variability of the transport time series has a dominant period of two years. This signal is related to the Indian Ocean Dipole index and is transported via the South Equatorial Current. A negative phase of the dipole induces an increase of the southward transport in the Mozambique Channel with a lag of roughly one year. The salinity anomaly in the years 2000 – 2001 is related to the weakening of the northern part of the South Equatorial Current. This results in a reduced inflow of tropical, relatively fresh waters. The seasonal cycle of the transport has an amplitude of about 5 Sv and originates from upstream variability in the wind forcing west of the Mascarene Ridge. In the observations, this signal is overshadowed by variability at other frequencies. In Ocean General Circulation Models on the other hand, this frequency dominates the throughflow, as these models underrepresent variability at other, especially higher, frequencies. Variability at the eddy time scale is very strong in the observed volume transport time series. This is due to the formation of Mozambique Channel eddies around the location of the mooring section. The alternation between a strong southward current and eddies formed out of this current is causing the strong variability. In eddy resolving Ocean General Circulation Models, eddies are formed further upstream and therefore no alternation takes place at the mooring section. Nevertheless, the velocity structure of eddies in these models is quite well simulated. Using relatively simple models, it is shown that the estimated transport through the channel is very sensitive to the model setup and the simulation of barotropic and / or baroclinic variability. Rectification of the mean flow by this variability was strongest along the north and south boundary of the island. Also, the amount of rectification was sensitive to the basin setup.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brzeziński, Aleksander</author><author>Nastula, Jolanta</author><author>Kołaczek, Barbara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal excitation of polar motion estimated from recent geophysical models and observations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodynamics</full-title></periodical><pages>235-240</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>3-5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jog.2009.09.021</electronic-resource-num><notes>Brzeziński, A., Nastula, J., &amp;amp; Kołaczek, B.

The power input by fluctuations in atmospheric pressure pa resulting from the S1 and S2 air tides and the stochastic continuum is analyzed here, with a focus on globally integrated, time-mean values. Results are based on available 1° × 1° near-global pa and sea level fields and are intended as mainly order-of-magnitude estimates. The rate of work done on the radiational and gravitational components of the S2 ocean tide is estimated at 14 and −60 GW, respectively, mostly occurring at low latitudes. The net extraction of energy at a rate of −46 GW is about 10% of available estimates of the work rates by gravity on the S2 tide. For the mainly radiational S1 tide, the power input by pa is much weaker (0.25 GW). Based on daily mean quantities, the stochastic pa continuum contributes ∼3 GW to the nontidal circulation, with substantial power input being associated with the pa-driven dynamic response in the Southern Ocean at submonthly time scales. Missing contributions from nontidal variability at the shortest periods (≤ 2 days) may be substantial, but the rate of work done by pa on the general circulation is likely to remain &lt; 1% of the available wind input estimates. The importance of pa effects when considering local, time-variable energetics remains a possibility, however.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Jin</author><author>Zhou, Yong-Hong</author><author>Liao, De-Chun</author><author>Chen, Jian-Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Excitation of Chandler Wobble by Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans from 1980 to 2005</title><secondary-title>Chinese Astronomy and Astrophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Astronomy and Astrophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>410-420</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chinastron.2009.09.007</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ma, J., Zhou, Y.-H., Liao, D.-C., &amp;amp; Chen, J.-L.

This paper reviews existing ocean analysis efforts aimed at initializing seasonal forecasts. We show that ocean data assimilation improves the skill of seasonal forecasts in many cases, although its impact can be overshadowed by errors in the coupled models. The current practice, known as “uncoupled” initialization, has the advantage of better knowledge of atmospheric forcing fluxes, but it has the shortcoming of potential initialization shock. In recent years, the idea of obtaining truly “coupled” initialization, where the different components of the coupled system are well balanced, has stimulated several research activities that will be reviewed in light of their application to seasonal forecasts.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>North Pacific Acoustic Laboratory: Analysis of Shadow Zone Arrivals and Acoustic Propagation in Numerical Ocean Models</title></titles><periodical/><pages>12</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><notes>Dushaw, B.

Some of the observations included shadow-zone arrivals, that appear at travel times aligned with the lower cusps of the acoustic time front predicted by ray calculations, but with the depth of the receiver lies well below the depths of the predicted cusps. Several models for the temperature and salinity in the North Pacific Ocean were obtained and processed to enable simulations of acoustic propagation for comparison to the observations. New tools were developed to manage the large size of the model output, to extract and construct the relevant acoustic properties from the model output, and to make the acoustic calculations. Computer codes using ray tracing and the parabolic equation to calculate acoustic properties were significantly developed. The acoustic data show that WOA05 is a better estimate of the time-mean hydrography than either the JPL-ECCO or the POP estimates, which proved incapable of reproducing the observed acoustic arrival patterns.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fernández, L.I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of Geophysical Variations of the C20 Coefficient of the Geopotential</title><secondary-title>Observing our Changing Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Observing our Changing Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>493-500</pages><volume>133</volume><keywords><keyword>Earth rotation</keyword><keyword>Geopotencial</keyword><keyword>Gravity</keyword><keyword>Hydrology</keyword><keyword>Length-of-day</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><pub-location>Berlin, Heidelberg</pub-location><publisher>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher><isbn>9783540854258</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-540-85426-5_59</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fernández, L. .

In particular, we analyzed the agreement of the hydrological C 20 changes as estimated by the Land Dynamics Model (LaD) model. The computation spans between January 1980 and May 2004 for the hydrological model The contribution of atmospheric mass redistributions, along with the oceanic mass terms and solid Earth tides were removed from the geodetic C 20 time series for computing residuals. Afterward the hydrological influence was investigated After eliminating seasonal variations, the hydrological excitation seems to be not adequate to explain the inter-annual variations found in the C 20 residuals The luni-solar precession and nutation of the Earth depend on the dynamical flattening (H); which is related to the principal moments of inertia of the whole planet. H is linked to the C 20 coefficient of the Earth's potential, which is regularly determined by space geodetic techniques In this work, we also estimate the seasonal variations on H due to geophysical causes. These results should be useful to investigate the geophysical considerations in the computation of the IAU 2000 precesion-nutation model. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Veneziani, M.</author><author>Edwards, C.

Two years ago, NASA was on the verge of dramatically enhancing its HEC capability and capacity by significantly increasing its computational and storage resources. With the 10,240-processor Columbia supercomputer in production since Oc- tober 2004, HEC is having an even greater impact within the Agency and beyond. Advanced science and engineering simulations in space exploration, Shuttle operations, Earth sciences, and fundamental aeronautics research are occurring on Columbia, demonstrating its ability to accelerate NASA’s ex- ploration vision. This paper describes how the integrated production environ- ment fostered at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) facility at Ames Research Center is reducing design cycle times, accelerating scientific discov- ery, achieving rapid parametric analyses of multiple scenarios, and enhancing safety for several NASA missions. We focus on Columbia’s impact on two key engineering and science disciplines: aerospace, and climate/weather. We also discuss future mission challenges and plans for NASA’s next-generation HEC environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Broquet, G.</author><author>Edwards, C.A.</author><author>Moore, A.M.</author><author>Powell, B.S.</author><author>Veneziani, M.</author><author>Doyle, J.D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of 4D-Variational data assimilation to the California Current System</title><secondary-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>69-92</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>1-3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2009.03.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Broquet, G., Edwards, C.

The time series of the first empirical orthogonal function of the MOC is found to be correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, while the associated circulation anomalies correspond to cells extending over the full ocean depth. Model sensitivity experiments suggest that the wind is responsible for most of this interannual variability, at least south of 40 degrees N. A dynamical decomposition of the meridional streamfunction allows a further look into the mechanisms. In particular, the contributions associated with 1) the Ekman flow and its depth-independent compensation, 2) the vertical shear flow, and 3) the barotropic gyre flowing over zonally varying topography are examined. Ekman processes are found to dominate the shorter time scales (1.5-3 yr), while for longer time scales (3-10 yr) the MOC variations associated with vertical shear flow are of greater importance. The latter is primarily caused by heaving of the pycnocline in the western subtropics associated with the stronger wind forcing. Finally, how these changes in the MOC affect the meridional heat transport (MHT) is examined. It is found that overall, Ekman processes explain a larger part of interannual variability (3-10 yr) for MHT (57%) than for the MOC (33%).</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Hill, Christopher N.</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Nguyen, An T.</author><author>Schodlok, Michael P.</author><author>Zhang, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ECCO2: High Resolution Global Ocean and Sea Ice Data Synthesis</title><secondary-title>Mercator Ocean Quarterly Newsletter</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mercator Ocean Quarterly Newsletter</full-title></periodical><pages>13-21</pages><volume>31</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><notes>Menemenlis, D., Campin, J.-M., Heimbach, P., Hill, C.

The CGCM consists of the University of California, Los Angeles, Atmospheric GCM (UCLA AGCM) and an ECCO ocean configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology GCM (MITgcm). The forecasts correspond to ensemble seasonal hindcasts for the period 1993–2001. For the forecasts, the ocean component of the CGCM is initialized in either early March or in early June using ocean states provided either by an unconstrained forward ocean integration of the MITgcm (the “baseline” hindcasts) or by data-constrained ECCO results (the “ECCO” hindcasts). Forecast skill for both the baseline and the ECCO hindcasts is significantly higher than persistence and compares well with the skill of other state-of-the art CGCM forecast systems. For March initial conditions, the standard errors of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in ECCO hindcasts (relative to observed anomalies) are up to 1°C smaller than in the baseline hindcasts over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific (150°–120°W). For June initial conditions, the errors of ECCO hindcasts are up to 0.5°C smaller than in the baseline hindcasts. The smaller standard error of the ECCO hindcasts is, in part, due to a more realistic equatorial thermocline structure of the ECCO initial conditions. This study confirms the value of physically consistent ocean-state estimation for the initialization of seasonal climate forecasts.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Production and analysis of an eddy-permitting Southern Ocean state estimate</title></titles><periodical/><volume>S.

To obtain some basic physical insight into their behavior, a global ocean circulation model, forced to least-square consistency with modern data, is used to find lower bounds for the time taken by surface-injected passive tracers to reach equilibrium. Depending upon the geographical scope of the injection, major gradients exist, laterally, between the abyssal North Atlantic and North Pacific, and vertically over much of the ocean, persisting for periods longer than 2000 years and with magnitudes bearing little or no relation to radiocarbon ages. The relative vigor of the North Atlantic convective process means that tracer events originating far from that location at the sea surface will tend to display abyssal signatures there first, possibly leading to misinterpretation of the event location. Ice volume (glacio-eustatic) corrections to deep-sea δ 18 O values, involving fresh water addition or subtraction, regionally at the sea surface, cannot be assumed to be close to instantaneous in the global ocean, and must be determined quantitatively by modelling the flow and by including numerous more complex dynamical interactions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, S B</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A near uniform basin-wide sea level fluctuation over the Japan/East Sea: A semienclosed sea with multiple straits</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>113</volume><issue>C6</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric-pressure</keyword><keyword>barotropic flow</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>difference</keyword><keyword>geostrophic control</keyword><keyword>gibraltar</keyword><keyword>mediterranean sea</keyword><keyword>model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2007jc004409</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kim, S.

A significant fraction of the Japan/East Sea sea level variability is found to be spatially uniform with periods ranging from 20 d to a year. The model simulation is consistent with T/P records in terms of the basin-wide sea level fluctuation's spectral energy and coherence. The simulation indicates that the changes are barotropic in nature and controlled, notably at high frequencies, by the net mass transport through the straits of the Japan/East Sea driven by winds in the vicinity of the Korea/Tsushima and Soya Straits. A series of barotropic simulations suggest that the sea level fluctuations are the result of a dynamic balance at the straits among near-strait winds, friction, and geostrophic control. The basin-wide sea level response is a linear superposition of changes due to winds near the individual straits. In particular, a basin-wide sea level response can be established by winds near either one of the straits alone. For the specific geometry and winds, winds near the Soya Strait have a larger Strait.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eddy-induced meridional heat transport in the ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>35</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>eddy heat transport</keyword><keyword>oceanic heat transport</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008GL035490</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

In contrast to buoy drift, the density and extent of the RGPS coverage allows a more extensive assessment and understanding of model simulations at spatial scales from ∼10 km to near basin scales and from days to seasonal timescales. This work illustrates the strengths of the RGPS data set as a basis for examining model ice drift and its gradients. As it is not our intent to assess relative performance, we have selected four models with a range of attributes and grid resolution. Model fields are examined in terms of ice drift, export, deformation, deformation-related ice production, and spatial deformation patterns. Even though the models are capable of reproducing large-scale drift patterns, variability among model behavior is high. When compared to the RGPS kinematics, the characteristics shared by the models are (1) ice drift along coastal Alaska and Siberia is slower, (2) the skill in explaining the time series of regional divergence of the ice cover is poor, and (3) the deformation-related volume production is consistently lower. Attribution of some of these features to specific causes is beyond our current scope because of the complex interplay between model processes, parameters, and forcing. The present work suggests that high-resolution ice drift observations, like those from the RGPS, would be essential for future model developments, improvements, intercomparisons, and especially for evaluation of the small-scale behavior of models with finer grid spacing.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Park, S</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Lukas, R</author><author>Santiago-Mandujano, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Causes for large-scale hydrographic changes at the Hawaii Ocean time series station</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1931-1948</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>anomalies</keyword><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>decadal climate variability</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>rossby waves</keyword><keyword>subtropical gyre</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2008jpo3751.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., S.

The comparison shows that at this position, the estimated temporal variability has some skill in simulating observed ocean variability and that the quality of future syntheses could benefit from additional information available from the Argo network and from the time series observations themselves. On a decadal time scale, the influence radius of the station ALOHA T-S time series covers large parts of the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean and reaches even into the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Throughflow. Estimated changes in sea surface height (SSH) result largely from thermosteric changes; however, nonsteric (barotropic) variations on the order of 1-2 cm also contribute to SSH changes at station ALOHA. Moreover, changes of similar magnitude can be caused by changes in the salinity field because of a quasi-biennial oscillation in the horizontal flow structure and heaving of the mean salinity structure on seasonal and interannual time scales. The adjoint modeling framework confirms westward-propagating Rossby waves (due to wind forcing) and subduction of water-mass anomalies (due to surface buoyancy forcing) as the primary mechanisms leading to observed changes of T-S structures at station ALOHA. Specifically, the analysis identifies surface freshwater fluxes along the wintertime outcrop of intermediate waters as a primary cause for salinity changes at station ALOHA and wind stress forcing east of the station position as another forcing mechanism of salinity variations around the Hawaiian Archipelago.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fox-Kemper, B</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can Large Eddy Simulation Techniques Improve Mesoscale Rich Ocean Models?</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modeling in an Eddying Regime</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modeling in an Eddying Regime</full-title></periodical><pages>319-337</pages><keywords><keyword>Ocean circulation—Mathematical models</keyword><keyword>Oceanography—Mathematical models</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>American Geophysical Union</publisher><isbn>9781118666432</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/177GM19</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fox-Kemper, B., &amp;amp; Menemenlis, D.

The estimate results from a synthesis of most of the ocean datasets available during this 50-yr period with the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean/Massachusetts Institute of Technology (ECCO/MIT) ocean circulation model. Over the period 1992 through 2001, the increase in thermosteric sea level rise on average amounts to 1.2 mm yr(-1) over the top 750 m and 1.8 mm yr(-1) over the total water column. This corresponds to an increase in upper-ocean heat content of 1.5x10(22) J yr(-1) and is in agreement with the estimates of Willis et al. However, over the period 1962 through 2001 the global net thermosteric sea level rise is estimated as 0.66 mm yr-1 over the top 750 m, which is twice the recent estimate from Antonov et al. (0.33 mm yr(-1)). The corresponding trend over the total water column of 0.92 mm yr(-1) is also about twice their value for the layer of 0-3000 m (0.40 mm yr(-1)). For the last decade, the global heat flux into the ocean of 1.5 W m(-2) is twice as large as the recent estimate by Willis et al. due to the heat content change in deeper layers. Regional changes in sea level are predominantly associated with an intensification of the subtropical gyre circulation and a corresponding redistribution of heat. The horizontal advection of heat due to an increase in wind stress curl is found to explain a major fraction of the estimated regional sea level trends over the last 40 years. However, the mechanisms appear different during the last decade when in some regions changes in surface heat flux may explain as much as 50% of the sea level changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Quinn, Katherine J</author><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating weights for the use of time-dependent gravity recovery and climate experiment data in constraining ocean models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>113</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>1217 Time variable gravity</keyword><keyword>1222 Ocean monitoring with geodetic techniques</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword><keyword>errors</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC004903</electronic-resource-num><notes>Quinn, K.

We attempt a spatial mapping of these errors by comparing several GRACE data products to pb simulations from an ocean model. Uncertainties in the global ocean mean , partly related to the net freshwater flux into the ocean, and in the regional pb anomalies about that mean are considered separately. The resultant regional error estimates (∼1–3 cm), when zonally averaged, are comparable to the calibrated errors provided by the GRACE processing centers, except for enhanced errors near some continental regions with high seasonal hydrology signals or large mass trends. Errors in the GRACE-derived values estimated from model-data differences (∼0.2 cm) are also comparable with those from the calibrated errors. For both pb and estimates, accounting for the effects of geocenter noise is important. Replacing the C20 harmonic term in the GRACE data with estimates derived from satellite laser ranging results in significantly lower errors in the Southern Ocean. We also find lower errors at high latitudes when the variability of the atmospheric pressure over the land is removed from the data. Given the estimated errors and model-data comparisons, GRACE data should be useful for constraining estimates of , particularly at interannual periods, but less so when considering regional pb variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkov, Denis L.</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of vorticity fluxes in the dynamics of the Zapiola Anticyclone</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>113</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4277 Time series experiments</keyword><keyword>4512 Currents</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>Vorticity fluxes</keyword><keyword>Zapiola Anticyclone</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008JC004841</electronic-resource-num><notes>Volkov, D.

A number of observations have discovered an intense anticyclonic gyre of barotropic circulation around the Zapiola Rise in the center of the basin. Theoretical studies have shown that the Zapiola Anticyclone represents an eddy-driven flow controlled by bottom friction. Recent advances in high-resolution global-ocean data syntheses, performed using NASA supercomputing facilities, provide realistic simulations of the circulation and the variability in the Argentine Basin. Using these simulations and satellite altimeter observations, we analyzed the vorticity balance of the Zapiola Anticyclone. Our results suggest the dominance of vorticity fluxes and the advection of the potential vorticity over a nonuniform bottom topography in determining the variability of the gyre, while the impact of the local wind stress is small. The divergence of the relative vorticity anomaly advection by eddies is found to be the most important contributor to the relative vorticity flux divergence influencing the variability of the Zapiola Anticyclone. Our results demonstrate that the relative vorticity influencing the variability of the anticyclone is mainly advected from the south where the northern branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current at the Subpolar Front is located.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Marshall, J</author><author>Ferreira, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sea ice-ocean coupling using a rescaled vertical coordinate z*</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>atmosphere</keyword><keyword>boundary-conditions</keyword><keyword>circulation models</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>conservation</keyword><keyword>formulation</keyword><keyword>free-surface</keyword><keyword>fresh-water flux</keyword><keyword>ocean model</keyword><keyword>sea ice model</keyword><keyword>simulations</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>vertical coordinate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2008.05.005</electronic-resource-num><notes>Campin, J.-M., Marshall, J., &amp;amp; Ferreira, D.

In particular, the adoption of &quot;z*&quot; avoids the difficult issue of vanishing levels under thick ice. Details of the implementation within MITgcm are provided. A high resolution global ocean sea ice simulation illustrates the robustness of the z* formulation and reveals a source of oceanic variability associated with sea ice dynamics and ice-loading effects. The use of the z* coordinate allows one to achieve perfect conservation of fresh water, heat and salt, as shown in extended integration of coupled ocean sea ice atmospheric model.

Fitting the real hydrographic observations leads to vast improvements in the model circulation, including the sea surface height and the meridional heat transport. We find striking differences in basin-scale transports compared with previous assimilation experiments that use the same GCM and a similar spatial resolution. Based on forward modeling studies, it is argued that these differences are due to different assimilation experiment durations. Over 1 year, the hydrography interpolated with the GCM from Argo profiles better represents the contemporary structures than does a long-term averaged climatology. The GCM dynamics are robust enough to distinguish between contemporary hydrography and climatological hydrography.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schott, F A</author><author>Stramma, L</author><author>Wang, W</author><author>Giese, B S</author><author>Zantopp, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pacific Subtropical Cell variability in the SODA 2.0.2/3 assimilation</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>35</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008gl033757</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schott, F.

The state estimate combines most available observations, including all the altimetric missions, with a general circulation model in an optimization procedure. The annual cycle tends to be larger than the semi-annual one, except in tropical regions. For global mean ζ, annual thermosteric and freshwater terms are nearly out-of-phase and lead to an annual cycle of only a few mm in amplitude. Regionally, surface wind stress and heat flux are the primary drivers for seasonal ζ variations in the tropics and midlatitudes, respectively, with both mechanisms playing a role at high latitudes. A substantial part of the annual ζ variability can be assigned to changes in thermosteric height in the upper 100 m in midlatitudes and 200 m in the tropics. Bottom pressure variability is larger at high latitudes, and also in some regions in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific. Apparent nonlinear rectification processes lead to a noticeable impact of submonthly forcing on the annual cycle in the western North Atlantic and North Pacific. Other features include the substantial ζ gradients associated with strong spatial variability in seasonal surface heat flux in some western boundary regions, the damping effects of surface heat flux on the seasonal cycle in the tropics, and the importance of wind driving and bottom pressure in shallow regions, which can cause differences in the seasonal cycle in some coastal and contiguous deep-ocean regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, Gaël</author><author>Ferron, Bruno</author><author>Mercier, Herlé</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining Argo profiles with a general circulation model in the North Atlantic.

Here we present idealized experiments where the adjoint method is used to synthesize simulated sets of Argo profiles with a general circulation model, over a one-year period, in the North Atlantic. Using a number of drifting profilers consistent with Argo deployment objectives, the simulated array permits one to identify large-scale anomalies in the hydrography and circulation, despite the presence of a simulated eddy noise of large amplitude. Model dynamics provide an objective means to distinguish eddy noise from large-scale oceanic variability, and to infer the absolute velocity field (including abyssal velocities and sea surface height) from sets of Argo profiles of T and S. In particular, our idealized experiments suggest that volume and heat transports can be efficiently constrained by sets of Argo profiles. Increasing the number of Argo floats seems to be an adequate strategy to further reduce errors in circulation estimates.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of the meridional overturning in the North Atlantic from the 50-year GECCO state estimation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1913-1930</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric</keyword><keyword>boundary-layer parameterization</keyword><keyword>co2</keyword><keyword>decadal changes</keyword><keyword>global ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>heat-transport</keyword><keyword>labrador sea</keyword><keyword>mechanisms</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>overflow</keyword><keyword>thermohaline circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2008jpo3775.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kohl, A., and D.

The GECCO synthesis combines most of the data available during the entire estimation period with the ECCO-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) ocean circulation model using its adjoint. This GECCO estimate is analyzed here for the period 1962-2001 with respect to decadal and longer-term changes of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the North Atlantic. A special focus is on the maximum MOC values at 25 degrees N. Over this period, the dynamically self-consistent synthesis stays within the error bars of H. L. Bryden et al., but reveals a general increase of the MOC strength. The variability on decadal and longer time scales is decomposed into contributions from different processes. Changes in the model's MOC strength are strongly influenced by the southward communication of density anomalies along the western boundary originating from the subpolar North Atlantic, which are related to changes in the Denmark Strait overflow but are only marginally influenced by water mass formation in the Labrador Sea. The influence of density anomalies propagating along the southern edge of the subtropical gyre associated with baroclinically unstable Rossby waves is found to be equally important. Wind-driven processes such as local Ekman transport explain a smaller fraction of the variability on those long time scales.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danabasoglu, Gokhan</author><author>Ferrari, Raffaele</author><author>McWilliams, James C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sensitivity of an Ocean General Circulation Model to a Parameterization of Near-Surface Eddy Fluxes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>1192-1208</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Ocean circulation,Eddies,Mesoscale processes,Surfa</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2007JCLI1508.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Danabasoglu, G., R.

This scheme includes the effects of diabatic mesoscale fluxes within the surface layer. The experiments with the new parameterization show significant improvements compared to a control integration that tapers the effects of the eddies as the surface is approached. Such surface tapering is typical of present implementations of eddy transport in some current ocean models. The comparison is also promising versus available observations and results from an eddy-resolving model. These improvements include the elimination of strong, near-surface, eddy-induced circulations and a better heat transport profile in the upper ocean. The experiments with the new scheme also show reduced abyssal cooling and diminished trends in the potential temperature drifts. Furthermore, the need for any ad hoc, near-surface taper functions is eliminated. The impact of the new parameterization is mostly associated with the modified eddy-induced velocity treatment near the surface. The new parameterization acts in the depth range exposed to enhanced turbulent mixing at the ocean surface. This depth range includes the actively turbulent boundary layer and a transition layer underneath, composed of waters intermittently exposed to mixing. The mixed layer, that is, the regions of weak stratification at the ocean surface, is found to be a good proxy for the sum of the boundary layer depth and transition layer thickness.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoteit, I</author><author>Cornuelle, B</author><author>Thierry, V</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of resolution and optimized ECCO forcing on Simulations of the tropical pacific</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>131-147</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>1997-98 el-nino</keyword><keyword>assimilation</keyword><keyword>cold-tongue</keyword><keyword>coupled model</keyword><keyword>data</keyword><keyword>equatorial undercurrent</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>ncep-ncar</keyword><keyword>part i</keyword><keyword>reanalysis</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>wind stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/2007jtecho528.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hoteit, I., B.

During runs covering the period 1992-2002, two different sets of surface forcing boundary conditions are used, obtained 1) from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis project and 2) from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) assimilation consortium. The &quot;ECCO forcing&quot; is the &quot;NCEP forcing&quot; adjusted by a state estimation procedure using the MITgcm with a 1 degrees x 1 degrees global grid and the adjoint method assimilating a multivariate global ocean dataset. The skill of the model is evaluated against ocean observations available in situ and from satellites. The model domain is limited to the tropical Pacific, with open boundaries located along 26 degrees S, 26 degrees N, and in the Indonesian throughflow. To account for large-scale changes of the ocean circulation, the model is nested in the global time-varying ocean state provided by the ECCO consortium on a 1 grid. Increasing the spatial resolution to 1/3 degrees and using the ECCO forcing fields significantly improves many aspects of the circulation but produces overly strong currents in the western model domain. Increasing the resolution to 1/6 degrees does not yield further improvements of model results. Using the ECCO heat and freshwater fluxes in place of NCEP products leads to improved time-mean model skill (i.e., reduced biases) over most of the model domain, underlining the important role of adjusted heat and freshwater fluxes for improving model representations of the tropical Pacific. Combinations of ECCO and NCEP wind forcing fields can improve certain aspects of the model solutions, but neither ECCO nor NCEP winds show clear overall superiority.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>White, Laurent</author><author>Adcroft, Alistair J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A high-order finite volume remapping scheme for nonuniform grids: The piecewise quartic method (PQM)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Computational Physics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Computational Physics</full-title></periodical><pages>7394-7422</pages><volume>227</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>Compact schemes</keyword><keyword>Finite volume method</keyword><keyword>Nonuniform grids</keyword><keyword>Piecewise parabolic method (PPM)</keyword><keyword>Piecewise quartic method (PQM)</keyword><keyword>Reconstruction</keyword><keyword>Remapping</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcp.2008.04.026</electronic-resource-num><notes>White, L., and A.

The schemes are also compared based on remapping experiments in closed domains. The piecewise quartic method (PQM) is presented, based on fifth-order accurate piecewise polynomials, and is motivated by the need to significantly improve hybrid coordinate systems of ocean climate models, which require the remapping to be conservative, monotonic and highly accurate. A limiter for this scheme is fully described that never decreases the polynomial degree, except at the location of extrema. We assess the use of high-order explicit and implicit (i.e., compact) estimates for the edge values and slopes needed to build the piecewise polynomials in both piecewise parabolic method (PPM) and PQM. It is shown that all limited PQM schemes perform significantly better than limited PPM schemes and that PQM schemes are much more cost-effective.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuo, C Y</author><author>Shum, C K</author><author>Guo, J Y</author><author>Yi, Y C</author><author>Braun, A</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Matsumoto, K</author><author>Sato, T</author><author>Shibuya, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Southern Ocean mass variation studies using GRACE and satellite altimetry</title><secondary-title>Earth Planets and Space</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth Planets and Space</full-title></periodical><pages>477-485</pages><volume>60</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>grace</keyword><keyword>gravity</keyword><keyword>models</keyword><keyword>southern ocean</keyword><keyword>steric sea-level</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/BF03352814</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kuo, C.

The Southern Ocean sea level is poorly observed except from recent near-polar orbiting space geodetic satellites. In this study, the Southern Ocean mass variations at the seasonal scale are compared using three independent data sets: (1) the Gravity Recovery And Climate Recovery Experiment (GRACE) observed ocean bottom pressure (OBP), (2) steric-corrected satellite altimetry (ENVISAT) and, (3) the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model OBP data. The height difference between sea level derived from altimetry and steric sea level contains the vertical displacement of the Earth surface due to elastic loading. Here we provide a formulation of this loading term which has not been considered previously in other studies and demonstrate that it is not negligible, especially for regional studies. In this study, we first conduct a global comparison using steric-corrected JASON-1 altimetry with GRACE to validate our technique and to compare with recent studies. The global ocean mass variation comparison shows excellent agreement with high correlation (similar to 0.81) and with discrepancies at 3-5 mm RMS. However, the discrepancies in the Southern Ocean are much larger at 12-17 mm RMS. The mis-modeling of geocenter variations and the second degree zonal harmonic (J(2)) degrade the accuracy of GRACE-derived mass variations, and the choice of ocean temperature data sets and neglecting the loading correction on altimetry affect the OBP comparisons between GRACE and altimetry. This study indicates that the satellite observations (GRACE and ENVISAT) are capable of providing an improved constraint of oceanic mass variations in the Southern Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Losch, Martin</author><author>Schröder, Michael</author><author>Hohn, Sönke</author><author>Völker, Christoph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-Resolution Modelling of Phytoplankton Distribution and Adaptation</title><secondary-title>John von Neumann Institute for Computing Symposium 2008</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>John von Neumann Institute for Computing Symposium 2008</full-title></periodical><pages>289-296</pages><volume>39</volume><keywords><keyword>Global ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><isbn>978-3-9810843-5-1</isbn><notes>Losch, M., Schröder, M., Hohn, S., &amp;amp; Völker, C.

In its initial state the advection of a large number of tracers in the model caused an increase in MPI-exchange costs that inhibited a good scaling behaviour with increasing number of processors used. This has been overcome by bundling the MPI exchange for all tracers. First results from the model show a much improved representation of small-scale biological features, e.g. along the axis of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, a decoupling of the C and N cycles in nitrogen-limited subpolar gyres, and an increased Si:N ratio in iron-limited regions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Corchado, Juan Manuel</author><author>Mata, Aitor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting the Presence of Oil Slicks After an Oil Spill</title><secondary-title>Advances in Case-Based Reasoning</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Case-Based Reasoning</full-title></periodical><pages>573-586</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>Berlin, Heidelberg</pub-location><publisher>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-540-85502-6_39</electronic-resource-num><notes>Corchado, J.

Despite this, these processes are not routinely represented in global ocean and climate models. It is shown that a new ice shelf cavity model for z coordinate models can reproduce results from an intercomparison project of earlier approaches with vertical σ or isopycnic coordinates. As a proof of concept, ice shelves are incorporated in a 100-year global integration of a z coordinate model. In this simulation, glacial meltwater can be traced as far as north as 15°S. The observed effects of processes in the ice shelf cavities agree with previous results from a σ coordinate model, notably the increase in sea ice thickness. However, melt rates are overestimated probably because the parameterization of basal melting does not suit the low resolution of this configuration.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Thesis">2</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, Xujing Jia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Numerical and theoretical investigations of North Pacific subtropical mode water with implications to Pacific climate variability</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><notes>Davis, X.

In this, a High resolution MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm) simulation is analyzed to study the formation, isolation, dispersal of STMW and identify correlations between STMW variations and established climatic signals in the Pacific basin. During a 171-month time period (from January 1992 to March 2006), the seasonal variability is the dominant temporal variation observed. From climatological model fields, STMW exhibits distinct features in time and space. This can be seen more clearly by dividing the cycle into three distinct time periods: the formation, the isolation and the dissipation periods. In addition to seasonality there is also an interannual signal observed in STMW variability. This interannual variation pattern is connected closely to the climate shifts of North Pacific with further investigation showing that there is a high correlation between the STMW variability and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. To identify the mechanisms responsible for this interannual STMW variability, classical ocean thermocline theories are reviewed and STMW connections to large scale ocean circulation patterns are explored. A planetary geostrophic ocean model (PGOM) is employed as a theoretical platform for this purpose. Specifically, numerical PGOM experiments are performed to isolate and examine in further detail, the influence of variations of the large scale wind stress pattern and large scale air-sea heat flux on STMW variability. It may be gathered from these experiments that large scale wind stress patterns responsible for Ekman pumping are necessary for the generation of STMW in this ventilated thermocline scheme in the PGOM. Variability in this large scale wind stress is seen to affect the variability pattern of model STMW. Yet, results also indicate that the amplitude of seasonal and interannual variability of STMW volume is primarily dominated by the variability in the air-sea heat flux.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Plumb, R.

Thanks to the GRACE mission and in a lesser extent to LAGEOS missions, the mass term is determined since 2002, independently from any geophysical model. Besides the modeled excitations of the polar motion, i.e the atmospheric angular momentum (AAM), the Oceanic Angular Momentum (OAM), the Hydrological Angular Momentum (HAM), this gravimetric mass term is a new kind of information which can be matched to the observed excitation of the polar motion after removal of the effect of the relative angular momentum, mostly caused by the wind and the oceanic cur- rents. Such comparison, already performed by various authors, is updated for the last releases (RL04) of the gravity field changes i.e. those of the GFZ, CSR, JPL and explored for the mixed LAGEOS-GRACE solution of the GRGS. We confirm that a fair general agreement, especially for the y-component of the equatorial excitation. After removing the modeled oceanic and atmospheric excitations from the signals, we obtain the non-modeled excitation, mostly of hydrological nature; this allows us to compare them to the existing hydrological models, differences might comes from others Earth’s phenomena, for example, earthquakes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Göttl, F</author><author>Seitz, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contribution of Non-Tidal Oceanic Mass Variations to Polar Motion Determined from Space Geodesy and Ocean Data</title><secondary-title>Observing our Changing Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Observing our Changing Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>439-445</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>Berlin, Heidelberg</pub-location><publisher>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-540-85426-5_53</electronic-resource-num><notes>Göttl, F., &amp;amp; Seitz, F.

Sea level in the IPWP and the Western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) has distinct interannual variabilities related to ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) event. The mean sea level in the IPWP has a rising rate of 4.5 mm/yr over the 1993-2005 period, while the WPWP and the Indian Ocean warm pool (IOWP) have rising rate of 6.0 mm/yr and 1.6 mm/yr respectively. The trends of thermosteric sea level were also examined using Ishii data and MITgcm assimilation data and the results indicate that thermal change of upper layer has a significant contribution to the sea level variations in the WPWP. But the thermosteric sea level has little contribution to sea level change in the IOWP region.

The impact of continental hydrologic signals, from land water, snow, and ice, on polar motion excitation (hydrological angular momentum-HAM), is still inadequately known. Although estimates of HAM have been made from several models of global hydrology based upon the observed distribution of surface water, snow, and soil moisture, the relatively sparse observation network and the presence of errors in the data and the geophysical fluid models preclude a full understanding of the HAM influence on polar motion variations. Recently the GRACE mission monitoring Earths time variable gravity field has allowed us to determine the mass term of polar motion excitation functions and compare them with the mass term derivable as a residual from the geodetic excitation functions and geophysical fluid motion terms on seasonal time scales. Differences between these mass terms in the years 2004 - 2005.5 are still on the order of 20 mas. Besides the overall mass excitation of polar motion comparisons with GRACE (RL04-release), we also intercompare the non-atmospheric, non-oceanic signals in the mass term of geodetic polar motion excitation with hydrological excitation of polar motion.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, J.

We examine estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Earth rotation variations, climate models, and satellite laser ranging (SLR). Recently released GRACE solutions show significant improvement relative to earlier results, especially for ΔC21 and ΔS21. At the annual period, all estimates agree remarkably well, and good correlation is found among time series at intraseasonal periods. In general, Earth rotation values for ΔC21 and ΔS21, and SLR values for ΔC20 agree best with GRACE estimates. GRACE ΔC20 time series are contaminated by aliased ocean tide model errors. SLR ΔC21 and ΔS21 time series have been reported without an ocean pole tide (OPT) correction and with an older Solid Earth Pole Tide (SEPT) model. After correcting for OPT and SEPT deficiencies, SLR ΔC21 and ΔS21 time series show improved agreement with other estimates.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Korbacz, A</author><author>Nski, A Brzezi</author><author>Thomas, M</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Capitaine, Nicole</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical excitation of LOD/UT1 estimated from the output of the global circulation models of the atmosphere - ERA-40 reanalysis and of the ocean - OMCT</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the &quot;Journées Systèmes de Référence Spatio-temporels 2007&quot;</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the &quot;Journées Systèmes de Référence Spatio-temporels 2007&quot;</full-title></periodical><pages>188-191</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>Paris, France</pub-location><publisher>Observatoire de Paris</publisher><notes>Korbacz, A., Nski, A.

However, it is still unclear about how large the regional oceans contribute to the annual polar motion. We investigate systemically the contributions of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans to the excitation of the annual polar motion, based on the output data of ocean current velocity field and ocean bottom pressure field from &quot;Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO)&quot; ocean circulation model over the period 1993-2005. The result shows that due to its particular location and shape, the Atlantic Ocean makes a less significant contribution to the x-component of the annual polar motion excitation than the Pacific and Indian Oceans, while all these three oceans contribute to the y-component of the annual polar motion excitation to some extent.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Quinn, K J</author><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Heimbach, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of model and GRACE estimates of the large-scale seasonal cycle in ocean bottom pressure</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>34</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>errors</keyword><keyword>mass</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>system</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2007gl029599</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

The annual cycle in the spatial mean is a substantial part of the observed seasonal pb variability; net freshwater input and atmospheric pressure effects are both important. For the residual spatially-varying patterns, GRACE and model results agree well over the Southern Ocean where strongest variability at both annual and semiannual periods is present. Phase patterns tend to match well, although model amplitudes are generally weaker. Considerable uncertainty remains in both GRACE and model pb fields, judging from the spread among available estimates. Improving the pb estimates requires removal of data noise from aliasing and leakage of land hydrology signals, and further optimization of the ocean model, including possible use of GRACE data to constrain the solution.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, E S</author><author>Bonjean, F</author><author>Lagerloef, G S E</author><author>Gunn, J T</author><author>Mitchum, G T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validation and error analysis of OSCAR sea surface currents</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>688-701</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>equatorial pacific</keyword><keyword>in-situ</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>topex/poseidon</keyword><keyword>velocity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jtech1971.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Johnson, E.

At latitudes higher than 10 the zonal current correlation remains respectable, but OSCAR amplitudes diminish unrealistically. Variability of meridional currents is poorly reproduced, with severely diminished amplitudes and reduced correlations relative to those for zonal velocity on the equator. OSCAR's RMS differences from drifter velocities are very similar to those experienced by the ECCO ( Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) data- assimilating models, but OSCAR generally provides a larger ocean- correlated signal, which enhances its ratio of estimated signal over noise. Several opportunities exist for modest improvements in OSCAR fidelity even with presently available datasets.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gebbie, Geoffrey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does eddy subduction matter in the northeast Atlantic Ocean?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>112</volume><issue>C6</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4260 Ocean data assimilation and reanalysis</keyword><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4528 Fronts and jets</keyword><keyword>mesoscale eddies</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword><keyword>subduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006JC003568</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gebbie, G., 2007: Does eddy subduction matter in the northeast Atlantic Ocean?

Observations from the Subduction Experiment of the northeast Atlantic do not have the spatial resolution necessary to calculate eddy subduction and answer this question. Regional numerical models can diagnose subduction, but their representativeness is unknown. Furthermore, water mass budgets in an open-ocean domain show that the simulated properties of subducted water directly depend upon uncertain open-boundary conditions and surface fluxes. To remedy these problems, a state estimate of the ocean circulation is formed by constraining an eddy-permitting general circulation model to observations by adjusting the model parameters within their uncertainty. The resulting estimate is self-consistent with the equations of motion and has the necessary resolution for diagnosing subduction. In the northeast Atlantic during 1991–1993, the time-variable circulation contributes less than 1 Sv of net subduction, while the total subduction is 4 Sv. Eddy volume fluxes of 40 m/yr in the North Equatorial Current and the Azores Current, however, are significant and rival the subduction by Ekman pumping locally. Furthermore, a state estimate at 1/6° resolution has 2–3 Sv more subduction in the density bands centered around σ = 24.0 kg/m3 and σ = 26.0 kg/m3 than a 2° state estimate. This result implies that the inability to accurately simulate mesoscale phenomena and surface fluxes in climate models would lead to an accumulation of errors in water mass properties over 10–20 years, even in the interior of the subtropical gyre.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial Mapping of Time-Variable Errors in Jason-1 and TOPEX/Poseidon Sea Surface Height Measurements</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1078-1085</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Ocean models</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Satellites</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JTECH2029.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

Comparisons between the independent Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon and Jason-1 altimetric missions when they were in identical orbits show that point by point the data are consistent within the mission specifications of about 3-cm rms, but large-scale dependences exist in the data differences, and these are both poorly known and capable of introducing major errors into oceanic state estimates. Here the authors focus on the time-variable component of the spatially dependent errors. The analysis reveals errors ranging from 2 cm in the Tropics to 4 cm at mid- and high latitudes and roughly consistent with a dependence of instrument noise on significant wave height. Analysis of the representation errors suggests that, over the deep ocean, uncertainties associated with the simplifying assumption of an inverted barometer response to pressure loading are larger than the remaining errors in modeling the large-scale tides. Over extensive regions, however, errors associated with eddy signals missing in coarse resolution models dominate. Obtaining a more quantitative estimate of the latter errors remains a challenge.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, S B</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mechanisms controlling the interannual variation of mixed layer temperature averaged over the Nino-3 region</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>3822-3843</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>1997-98 el-nino</keyword><keyword>atlantic-ocean</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>conceptual-model</keyword><keyword>equatorial pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>heat-budget</keyword><keyword>part i</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>tropical instability waves</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/Jcli4206.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kim, S.

The overall balance is such that surface heat flux opposes the MLT change but horizontal advection and subsurface processes assist the change. Advective tendencies are estimated here as the temperature fluxes through the domain's boundaries, with the boundary temperature referenced to the domain-averaged temperature to remove the dependence on temperature scale. This allows the authors to characterize external advective processes that warm or cool the water within the domain as a whole. The zonal advective tendency is caused primarily by large-scale advection of warm-pool water through the western boundary of the domain. The meridional advective tendency is contributed to mostly by Ekman current advecting large-scale temperature anomalies through the southern boundary of the domain. Unlike many previous studies, the subsurface processes that consist of vertical mixing and entrainment are explicitly evaluated. In particular, a rigorous method to estimate entrainment allows an exact budget closure. The vertical mixing across the mixed layer (ML) base has a contribution in phase with the MLT change. The entrainment tendency due to the temporal change in ML depth is negligible compared to other subsurface processes. The entrainment tendency by vertical advection across the ML base is dominated by large-scale changes in upwelling and the temperature of upwelling water. Tropical instability waves (TIWs) result in smaller-scale vertical advection that warms the domain during La Nina cooling events. However, such a warming tendency is overwhelmed by the cooling tendency associated with the large-scale upwelling by a factor of 2. In summary, all the balance terms are important in the MLT budget except the entrainment due to lateral induction and temporal variation in ML depth. All three advective tendencies are primarily caused by large-scale and low-frequency processes, and they assist the Nino-3 MLT change. When the advective tendencies are evaluated by spatially averaging the conventional local advection of temperature, the apparent effects of currents with spatial scales smaller than the domain (such as TIWs) become very important as they redistribute heat within the Nino-3 domain. As a result, for example, the averaged zonal advective tendency counteracts rather than assists the Nino-3 MLT change. However, such internal redistribution of heat does not represent external processes that control the domain-averaged MLT.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Forget, G</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated global hydrographic variability</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1997-2008</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>energy</keyword><keyword>height</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>scales</keyword><keyword>temporal-changes</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo3072.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Forget, G., and C.

Root-mean-square vertical displacements in the upper 300 m of the ocean are generally smaller than 50 m, except in energetic boundary currents and in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Variability in temperature and salinity is strongly correlated below the top 100 m. Salinity contributions to sea surface height variability appear more significant at low latitudes than expected, possibly resulting from advective and diffusive processes. Results are generally consistent with altimetric variability under two simple kinematic hypotheses, and much of the observed structure coincides with known dynamical features. A large fraction of the sea surface height variability is consistent with the hypothesis of dominance of the first baroclinic mode.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Lee, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A near-uniform basin-wide sea level fluctuation of the Mediterranean Sea</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>338-358</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>atmospheric-pressure</keyword><keyword>black-sea</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>flow-through</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>strait-of-gibraltar</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/Jpo3016.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., D.

More than 50% of the large-scale, nontidal, and non-pressure-driven variance of sea level can be attributed to this oscillation, which is nearly uniform in phase and amplitude across the entire basin. The oscillation has periods ranging from 10 days to several years and has a magnitude as large as 10 cm. The model suggests that the fluctuations are driven by winds at the Strait of Gibraltar and its neighboring region, including the Alboran Sea and a part of the Atlantic Ocean immediately to the west of the strait. Winds in this region force a net mass flux through the Strait of Gibraltar to which the Mediterranean Sea adjusts almost uniformly across its entire basin with depth-independent pressure perturbations. The wind-driven response can be explained in part by wind setup; a near-stationary balance is established between the along-strait wind in this forcing region and the sea level difference between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The amplitude of this basin-wide wind-driven sea level fluctuation is inversely proportional to the setup region's depth but is insensitive to its width including that of Gibraltar Strait. The wind-driven fluctuation is coherent with atmospheric pressure over the basin and contributes to the apparent deviation of the Mediterranean Sea from an inverse barometer response.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Köhl, A</author><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Cornuelle, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual to Decadal Changes in the ECCO Global Synthesis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>313-337</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>florida current</keyword><keyword>fresh-water</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>heat-transport</keyword><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>steady-state</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO3014.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Köhl, A., Stammer, D., &amp;amp; Cornuelle, B.

The estimate exactly satisfies the model equations without artificial sources or sinks of momentum, heat, and freshwater. To bring the model into agreement with observations, its initial temperature and salinity conditions were permitted to change, as were the time-dependent surface fluxes of momentum, heat, and freshwater. The estimation of these &quot;control variables&quot; is largely consistent with accepted uncertainties in the hydrographic climatology and meteorological analyses. The estimated time-mean horizontal transports of volume, heat, and freshwater, which were largely underestimated in the previous 2 optimization performed by Stammer et al., have converged with time-independent estimates from box inversions over most parts of the World Ocean. Trends in the model's heat content are 7% larger than those reported by Levitus and correspond to a global net heat uptake of about 1.1 W m(-2) over the model domain. The associated model trend in sea surface height over the estimation period resembles the observations from Ocean Topography Experiment ( TOPEX)/Poseidon over most of the global ocean. Sea surface height changes in the model are primarily steric but show contributions from mass redistributions from the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean and the Southern Ocean to the subtropical Pacific Ocean gyres. Steric contributions are primarily temperature based but are partly compensated by salt variation. However, the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean reveal a clear contribution of salt to large-scale sea level variations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Losch, Martin</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adjoint sensitivity of an ocean general circulation model to bottom topography</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>377-393</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>annual-mean climatology</keyword><keyword>antarctic circumpolar current</keyword><keyword>coarse-resolution</keyword><keyword>geopotential-coordinate models</keyword><keyword>heat-transport</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic circulation</keyword><keyword>overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>variational data assimilation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>Doi 10.1175/Jpo3017.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Losch, M., and P.

With the help of an adjoint model, it is shown that scalar diagnostics or objective functions in a coarse-resolution model, such as the transport through Drake Passage, the strength of the Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation, the Deacon cell, and the meridional heat transport across 32 S, are sensitive to bottom topography as much as they are to surface boundary conditions. For example, adjoint topography sensitivities of the transport through Drake Passage are large in choke-point areas such as the Crozet - Kerguelen Plateau and south of New Zealand; the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is sensitive to topography in the western boundary region of the North Atlantic Ocean and along the Scotland - Iceland Ridge. Many sensitivities are connected to steep topography and can be interpreted in terms of bottom form stress, that is, the product of bottom pressure and topography gradient. The adjoint sensitivities are found to agree with direct perturbation methods with deviations smaller than 30% for significant perturbations on time scales of 100 yr, so that the assumption of quasi linearity that is implicit in the adjoint method holds. The horizontal resolution of the numerical model affects the sensitivities to bottom topography, but large-scale patterns and the overall impact of changes in topography appear to be robust. The relative impact of changes in topography and surface boundary conditions on the model circulation is estimated by multiplying the adjoint sensitivities with assumed uncertainties. If the uncertainties are correlated in space, changing the surface boundary conditions has a larger impact on the scalar diagnostics than topography does, but the effects can locally be on the same order of magnitude if uncorrelated uncertainties are assumed. In either case, bottom topography variations within their prior uncertainties affect the solution of an ocean circulation model. To this extent, including topography in the control vector can be expected to compensate for identifiable model errors and, thus, to improve the solutions of estimation problems.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Rui M</author><author>Vinogradov, Sergey V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of Stratification on the Large-Scale Ocean Response to Barometric Pressure</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>245-258</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Model evaluation/performance,General circulation m</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO3010.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

The potential effects of stratification on this response are explored here using a general circulation model in a near-global domain with realistic coasts and bathymetry. Periodic forcing by the diurnal and semidiurnal atmospheric tides and 6-hourly stochastic forcing from weather center analyses are both examined. A global dynamic response (i.e., departures from inverted barometer behavior) is clear in the response to atmospheric tides; for stochastic forcing, the largest dynamic signals occur in shallow and semienclosed regions and at mid- and high latitudes. The influence of stratification in the dynamics is assessed by comparing surface and bottom pressure signals. Baroclinic effects are generally weak, particularly in the response to the large-scale atmospheric tides. Under stochastic forcing, largest differences between surface and bottom pressure signals reach 10%–20% of the surface signals and tend to occur in regions of enhanced topographic gradients. Bottom-intensified, localized interactions with topography seem to be involved. Enhanced baroclinicity is also seen at low latitudes, where stratification effects are also felt in the upper ocean. General implications for modeling the ocean response to high-frequency atmospheric and tidal forcing are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Grant, Scott</author><author>Chisholm, Sallie W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emergent Biogeography of Microbial Communities in a Model Ocean</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1843-1846</pages><volume>315</volume><issue>5820</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1138544</electronic-resource-num><notes>Follows, M.

The data include not only altimetric variability, but most of the modern hydrography, Argo float profiles, sea surface temperature, and other observations. Spatial-mean trends in altimetric data are explicitly suppressed to isolate global average long-term changes required by the in situ data alone. On large scales, some regions display strong signals although few individual points have statistically significant trends. In the regional patterns, thermal, salinity, and mass redistribution contributions are all important, showing that regional sea level change is tied directly to the general circulation. Contributions below about 900 m are significant, but not dominant, and are expected to grow with time as the abyssal ocean shifts. Estimates made here produce a global mean of about 1.6 mm yr−1, or about 60% of the pure altimetric estimate, of which about 70% is from the addition of freshwater. Interannual global variations may be dominated by the freshwater changes rather than by heating changes. The widely quoted altimetric global average values may well be correct, but the accuracies being inferred in the literature are not testable by existing in situ observations. Useful estimation of the global averages is extremely difficult given the realities of space–time sampling and model approximations. Systematic errors are likely to dominate most estimates of global average change: published values and error bars should be used very cautiously.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mikaloff Fletcher, S E</author><author>Gruber, N</author><author>Jacobson, A R</author><author>Gloor, M</author><author>Doney, S C</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Gerber, M</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Joos, F</author><author>Lindsay, K</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mouchet, A</author><author>Müller, S A</author><author>Sarmiento, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inverse estimates of the oceanic sources and sinks of natural CO2 and the implied oceanic carbon transport</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><volume>21</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>4504 Air/sea interactions</keyword><keyword>4805 Biogeochemical cycles</keyword><keyword>4806 Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>4845 Nutrients and nutrient cycling</keyword><keyword>air-sea CO2 exchange</keyword><keyword>and modelin</keyword><keyword>natural carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>ocean inversion</keyword><keyword>processes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006GB002751</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mikaloff Fletcher, S.

We employ a suite of 10 different Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs) to quantify the error arising from uncertainties in the modeled transport required to link the interior ocean observations to the surface fluxes. The results from the contributing OGCMs are weighted using a model skill score based on a comparison of each model's simulated natural radiocarbon with observations. We find a pattern of air-sea flux of natural CO2 characterized by outgassing in the Southern Ocean between 44°S and 59°S, vigorous uptake at midlatitudes of both hemispheres, and strong outgassing in the tropics. In the Northern Hemisphere and the tropics, the inverse estimates generally agree closely with the natural CO2 flux results from forward simulations of coupled OGCM-biogeochemistry models undertaken as part of the second phase of the Ocean Carbon Model Intercomparison Project (OCMIP-2). The OCMIP-2 simulations find far less air-sea exchange than the inversion south of 20°S, but more recent forward OGCM studies are in better agreement with the inverse estimates in the Southern Hemisphere. The strong source and sink pattern south of 20°S was not apparent in an earlier inversion study, because the choice of region boundaries led to a partial cancellation of the sources and sinks. We show that the inversely estimated flux pattern is clearly traceable to gradients in the observed ΔCgasex, and that it is relatively insensitive to the choice of OGCM or potential biases in ΔCgasex. Our inverse estimates imply a southward interhemispheric transport of 0.31 ± 0.02 Pg C yr−1, most of which occurs in the Atlantic. This is considerably smaller than the 1 Pg C yr−1 of Northern Hemisphere uptake that has been inferred from atmospheric CO2 observations during the 1980s and 1990s, which supports the hypothesis of a Northern Hemisphere terrestrial sink.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Lee, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atlantic to Mediterranean sea level difference driven by winds near Gibraltar strait</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>359-376</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>altimetry</keyword><keyword>atmospheric-pressure</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>flows</keyword><keyword>fluctuations</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/Jpo3015.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Menemenlis, D., I.

Theoretical arguments and numerical experiments establish that this wind-driven sea level difference is caused in part by storm surges due to alongshore winds near the North African coastline on the Atlantic side of Gibraltar. The fraction of the Moroccan coastal current offshore of the 284-m isobath is deflected across Gibraltar Strait, west of Camarinal Sill, resulting in a geostrophic surface pressure gradient that contributes to a sea level difference at the stationary limit. The sea level difference is also caused in part by the along-strait wind setup, with a contribution proportional to the along- strait wind stress and to the length of Gibraltar Strait and adjoining regions and inversely proportional to its depth. In the 20 - 360-day band, average transfer coefficients between the Atlantic - Alboran sea level difference and surface wind stress at 36 degrees N, 6.5 degrees W, estimated from barometrically corrected Ocean Topography Experiment ( TOPEX)/Poseidon data and NCEP - NCAR reanalysis data, are 0.10 +/- 0.04 m Pa(-1) with 1 +/- 5-day lag and 0.19 +/- 0.08 m Pa(-1) with 5 +/- 4-day lag for the zonal and meridional wind stresses, respectively. This transfer function is consistent with equivalent estimates derived from a 1992 - 2003 high-resolution barotropic simulation forced by the NCEP - NCAR wind stress. The barotropic simulation explains 29% of the observed Atlantic - Alboran sea level difference in the 20 - 360-day band. In turn, the Alboran and Mediterranean mean sea level time series are highly correlated, rho = 0.7 in the observations and rho = 0.8 in the barotropic simulation, hence providing a pathway for winds near Gibraltar Strait to affect the mean sea level of the entire Mediterranean.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schott, F A</author><author>Wang, W Q</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of Pacific subtropical cells in the 50-year ECCO assimilation</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>34</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>meridional overturning circulation</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>simulation</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006gl028478</electronic-resource-num><notes>Schott, F.

The GRACE BP signals are compared with those derived from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean ( ECCO) ocean modeling - assimilation system, and to a non-Boussinesq version of the Regional Ocean Model System ( ROMS). The discrepancy found between GRACE and the models is 1.7 cm(H2O) ( 1 cm(H2O) similar to 1 hPa), slightly lower than the 1.9 cm(H2O) estimated by the authors independently from propagation of GRACE errors. The northern signals are weak and uncorrelated among basins. The southern signals are strong, with a common seasonality. The seasonal cycle GRACE data observed in the Pacific and Indian Ocean sectors of the ACC are consistent, with annual and semiannual amplitudes of 3.6 and 0.6 cm(H2O) ( 1.1 and 0.6 cm(H2O) with ECCO), the average over the full southern path peaks ( stronger ACC) in the southern winter, on days of year 197 and 97 for the annual and semiannual components, respectively; the Atlantic Ocean annual peak is 20 days earlier. An approximate conversion factor of 3.1 Sv ( Sv equivalent to 106 m(3) s(-1)) of barotropic transport variability per cm(H2O) of BP change is estimated. Wind stress data time series from the Quick Scatterometer ( QuikSCAT), averaged monthly, zonally, and over the latitude band 40 degrees - 65 degrees S, are also constructed and subsampled at the same months as with the GRACE data. The annual and semiannual harmonics of the wind stress peak on days 198 and 82, respectively.

The study is based on several circulation estimates obtained over the period 1992–2002 by combining most of the available ocean datasets with a global general circulation model on a 1° horizontal grid and by exchanging only the EGM96 geoid model with two different geoid models available from GRACE. As compared to the EGM96-based solution, the GRACE geoid leads to an estimate of the ocean circulation that is more consistent with the Levitus temperature and salinity climatology. While not a formal proof, this finding supports the inference of a substantially improved GRACE geoid skill. However, oceanographic implications of the GRACE model are only modest compared to what can be obtained from ocean observations alone. To understand the extent to which this is merely a consequence of a not-optimally converged solution or if a much more accurate geoid field could in principle play a profound role in the ocean estimation procedure, an additional experiment was performed in which the geoid error was artificially reduced relative to all other datasets. Adjustments occur then in all elements of the ocean circulation, including 10% changes in the meridional overturning circulation and the corresponding meridional heat transport in the Atlantic. For an optimal use of new geoid fields, improved error information is required. The error budget of existing time-mean dynamic topography estimates may now be dominated by residual errors in time-mean altimetric corrections. Both these and the model errors need to be better understood before improved geoid estimates can be fully exploited. As is commonly found, the Southern Ocean is of particular concern.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Practical global oceanic state estimation</title><secondary-title>Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena</full-title></periodical><pages>197-208</pages><volume>230</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint</keyword><keyword>adjoint method</keyword><keyword>assimilation</keyword><keyword>atlantic circulation</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>construction</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>fitting dynamics</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>method of lagrange multipliers</keyword><keyword>ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>sensitivity-analysis</keyword><keyword>state estimate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.physd.2006.09.040</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., &amp;amp; Heimbach, P.

In practice, all such methods reduce, on the computer, to forms of least-squares. The global oceanographic problem is at the present time focussed primarily on smoothing, rather than forecasting, and the data types are unlike meteorological ones. As formulated in the consortium Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), an automatic differentiation tool is used to calculate the so-called adjoint code of the GCM, and the method of Lagrange multipliers used to render the problem one of unconstrained least squares minimization. Major problems today lie less with the numerical algorithms (least-squares problems can be solved by many means) than with the issues of data and model error. Results of ongoing calculations covering the period of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, and including among other data, satellite altimetry from TOPEX/POSEIDON, Jason-1, ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, and GFO, a global array of profiling floats from the Argo program, and satellite gravity data from the GRACE mission, suggest that the solutions are now useful for scientific purposes. Both methodology and applications are developing in a number of different directions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Admittance and coherence analyses are used to characterize the bottom pressure and sea level relationship as a function of period, horizontal spatial scale, and location. At the model grid scale (1°), bottom pressure is found to be essentially equivalent to sea level at periods &lt;30 days, except in the tropics. This equivalence still holds for longer periods ( 100 days), but only at high latitudes (&gt;60°) and in shallow depths (&lt;200 m). Elsewhere, bottom pressure and sea level fields can differ significantly. Results indicate an increase of the importance of baroclinic signals with decreasing latitude and spatial scale, with significant baroclinic signals at intra-seasonal and longer periods present in many subtropical and mid-latitude regions. Variability is clearly baroclinic at inter-annual periods, regardless of location and spatial scale. Results have broad implications for the interpretation and processing of both satellite altimetry and gravity data and for their assimilation into numerical models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danabasoglu, Gokhan</author><author>Marshall, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of vertical variations of thickness diffusivity in an ocean general circulation model</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>122-141</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Mesoscale eddy parameterization</keyword><keyword>Ocean general circulation model</keyword><keyword>Vertically varying thickness diffusivity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2007.03.006</electronic-resource-num><notes>Danabasoglu, G., and J.

The model is the coarse resolution version of the ocean component of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3). Guided by the results of Ferreira et al. (2005) [Ferreira, D., Marshall, J., Heimbach, P., 2005. Estimating eddy stresses by fitting dynamics to observations using a residual-mean ocean circulation model and its adjoint. J. Phys. Oceanogr. 35, 1891–1910.] we employ a vertical dependence of the diffusivity which varies with the stratification, N2, and is thus large in the upper ocean and small in the abyss. We experiment with vertical variations of diffusivity which are as large as 4000 m2 s−1 within the surface diabatic layer, diminishing to 400 m2 s−1 or so by a depth of 2 km. The new solutions compare more favorably with the available observations than those of the control which uses a constant value of 800 m2 s−1 for both thickness and isopycnal diffusivities. These include an improved representation of the vertical structure and transport of the eddy-induced velocity in the upper-ocean North Pacific, a reduced warm bias in the upper ocean, including the equatorial Pacific, and improved southward heat transport in the low- to mid-latitude Southern Hemisphere. There is also a modest enhancement of abyssal stratification in the Southern Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sachs, Julian P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cooling of Northwest Atlantic slope waters during the Holocene</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>L03609</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006GL028495</electronic-resource-num><notes>Sachs, J.

Through budget analysis of the seasonal excitations, maximum deficits in geophysical excitations occur in boreal spring to summer. If we assume a mass source on the Earth to compensate the deficits, a positive mass excess is expected around longitudes 90°E to 120°E or from 60°W to 90°W. Observation of the Earth rotation is useful for constraining geophysical excitations with some errors. The interannual variability in seasonal excitations also affects the estimation of Chandler parameters.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Verdy, A.</author><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Marshall, J.</author><author>Czaja, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carbon dioxide and oxygen fluxes in the Southern Ocean: Mechanisms of interannual variability</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>air&amp;hyphen</keyword><keyword>biogeochemical model</keyword><keyword>doi:10.1029/2006GB002916</keyword><keyword>http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006GB002916</keyword><keyword>sea interaction</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>0886-6236</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006GB002916</electronic-resource-num><notes>Verdy, A., Dutkiewicz, S., Follows, M.

Our results suggest that the nonseasonal variability is primarily driven by changes in entrainment of carbon-rich, oxygen-poor waters into the mixed layer during winter convection episodes. The Southern Annular Mode (SAM), known to impact the variability of air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide, is also found to affect oxygen fluxes. We find that El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also plays an important role in generating interannual variability in air-sea fluxes of carbon and oxygen. Anomalies driven by SAM and ENSO constitute a significant fraction of the simulated variability; the two climate indices are associated with surface heat fluxes, which control the modeled mixed layer depth variability. We adopt a Lagrangian view of tracers advected along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) to highlight the importance of convective mixing in inducing anomalous air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The idealized Lagrangian model captures the principal features of the variability simulated by the more complex model, suggesting that knowledge of entrainment, temperature, and mean geostrophic flow in the mixed layer is sufficient to obtain a first-order description of the large-scale variability in air-sea transfer of soluble gases. Distinct spatial and temporal patterns arise from the different equilibration timescales of the two gases.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nastula, J.</author><author>Kolaczek, B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spectral Characteristic of Polar Motion in the 2005-2006 and 1999-2000 Winters Seasons</title><secondary-title>Artificial Satellites</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Artificial Satellites</full-title></periodical><pages>1-7</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>1</keyword><keyword>10</keyword><keyword>2006 and 1999-2000 winters</keyword><keyword>2007</keyword><keyword>2478</keyword><keyword>42</keyword><keyword>doi</keyword><keyword>ificial satellites</keyword><keyword>motion in the 2005-</keyword><keyword>no</keyword><keyword>seasons</keyword><keyword>spectral characteristic of polar</keyword><keyword>v10018-007-0013-5</keyword><keyword>vol</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2478/v10018-007-0013-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>Nastula, J., &amp;amp; Kolaczek, B.

Initial performance estimates by Dickey et al. (1997) suggested a formal geoid RMS error better than 0.1 mm up to spherical harmonic degree 5. Now that the GRACE gravity models and data are available, it is evident that these original expectations were too optimistic. Our hypothesis is that this is partially explained by errors in geophysical background models that need to be applied in the GRACE data reduction, and that this effect was not considered by Dickey et al. (1997). We discuss the results of a closed-loop simulation, where satellite trajectory prediction software is used for the generation of GRACE range-rate data and GRACE orbit solutions with the help of the Global Positioning System (GPS). During the recovery step in our closed-loop simulation, we show that simulated nuisance signals (based on tide and air pressure model differences) map to a 0.7 mm geoid effect for periods longer than 3 months and to less than 0.4 mm for periods shorter than 3 months. The long-period geoid hydrology signal is at a level of 4.5 mm, while the short-period hydrology is at 0.25 mm. The long-period ocean bottom pressure (OBP) signal maps at 0.8 mm and for short periods it is 0.4 mm. We conclude that short-period effects are difficult to observe by GRACE and that long-period effects, like hydrology, are easier to recover than OBP variations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khatiwala, Samar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A computational framework for simulation of biogeochemical tracers in the ocean</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint techniques</keyword><keyword>biogeochemical modeling</keyword><keyword>chemical and biological tracers</keyword><keyword>computational methods</keyword><keyword>doi:10.1029/2007GB002923</keyword><keyword>http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GB002923</keyword><keyword>marine ecosystem modeling</keyword><keyword>ocean carbon cycle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>0886-6236</isbn><accession-num>247880600001</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2007GB002923</electronic-resource-num><notes>Khatiwala, S.

The framework is based on the “transport matrix” formulation, a scheme for capturing the complex three-dimensional transport of tracers in a general circulation model (GCM) as a sparse matrix, thus reducing the task of simulating tracers to a sequence of simple matrix-vector products. The principal advantages of this formulation are efficiency and convenience. It is many orders of magnitude more efficient than GCMs, allowing us to address problems that are currently either difficult or unaffordable with GCMs. The scheme also allows us to quickly “prototype” new biogeochemical parameterizations or “plug in” existing ones. This paper describes the key features and advantages of the transport matrix method, and illustrates its application to a series of realistic problems in chemical and biological oceanography. The examples range from simulation of a transient tracer (SF6) to adjoint sensitivity of a complex coupled biogeochemical model. Finally, the paper describes an efficient, portable, and freely available implementation of this computational scheme that provides the necessary framework for simulating any biogeochemical tracer.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Penven, Pierrick</author><author>Tan, Thi-anh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ROMSTOOLS User ’ s Guide</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><pub-location>Paris, France</pub-location><notes>Penven, P., &amp;amp; Tan, T.

In order to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimated fluxes owing to modeled transport and errors in the data, we employ 10 OGCMs and three scenarios representing biases in the data-based anthropogenic CO2 estimates. On the basis of the prescribed anthropogenic CO2 storage, we find a global uptake of 2.2 ± 0.25 Pg C yr−1, scaled to 1995. This error estimate represents the standard deviation of the models weighted by a CFC-based model skill score, which reduces the error range and emphasizes those models that have been shown to reproduce observed tracer concentrations most accurately. The greatest anthropogenic CO2 uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean and in the tropics. The flux estimates imply vigorous northward transport in the Southern Hemisphere, northward cross-equatorial transport, and equatorward transport at high northern latitudes. Compared with forward simulations, we find substantially more uptake in the Southern Ocean, less uptake in the Pacific Ocean, and less global uptake. The large-scale spatial pattern of the estimated flux is generally insensitive to possible biases in the data and the models employed. However, the global uptake scales approximately linearly with changes in the global anthropogenic CO2 inventory. Considerable uncertainties remain in some regions, particularly the Southern Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathways of eddies in the South Atlantic Ocean revealed from satellite altimeter observations</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>33</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>4512 Currents</keyword><keyword>4520 Eddies and mesoscale processes</keyword><keyword>4528 Fronts and jets</keyword><keyword>4556 Sea level: variations and mean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006GL026245</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fu, L.-L., 2006: Pathways of eddies in the South Atlantic Ocean revealed from satellite altimeter observations.

This study applies the formalism and methodology of state estimation, recently developed for the global, coarse-resolution problem, to eddy-permitting state estimation in regional domains. Two major challenges exist for a state estimate that is nested inside a global state estimate: (1) estimation of open-boundary conditions consistent with information interior and exterior to the regional domain and (2) estimation with the higher-resolution models of regional studies. Here a least squares cost function defines the problem of minimizing the misfit between a North Atlantic regional general circulation model and actual observations, including those of the Subduction Experiment. A first experiment, using a novel “multiscale” method to constrain the large-scale regional circulation, shows that the use of the adjoint of both an eddy-permitting model and its coarse-resolution twin leads to a solution of the least squares problem in a computationally practical way. Therefore no fundamental obstacle exists to constraining the large-scale regional circulation nested within a global circulation. A second experiment in the North Atlantic shows that the model circulation can be constrained to the full observational signal, including eddy variability, as observed at selected point locations. Both experiments in this study produce eddy-permitting state estimates which are exactly self-consistent with the equations of motion as embodied by a general circulation model. Therefore dynamical balances can be diagnosed and easily interpreted; in particular, a companion paper uses the state estimates to determine eddy subduction rates in the North Atlantic.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Controls on ocean productivity and air-sea carbon flux: An adjoint model sensitivity study</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>atmospheric co2</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>export</keyword><keyword>fertilization</keyword><keyword>impact</keyword><keyword>iron</keyword><keyword>northeast</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>phosphorus</keyword><keyword>phytoplankton growth</keyword><keyword>southern-ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/gl024987</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dutkiewicz, S., M.

Modeled productivity and carbon flux are found to be most sensitive to enhanced iron sources in high nitrate low chlorophyll regions. The relative response of productivity to an enhanced iron source is greatest in the Equatorial Pacific. Although surface macro-nutrients are more abundant in the Southern Ocean, nutrient utilization here is critically regulated by light limitation. Our results differ from those of previous studies which imposed depletion of surface nutrients and ignore the availability of light. However, the enhancement of oceanic carbon storage per unit increase in productivity is strongest in the high latitude oceans.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, X P</author><author>Heflin, M B</author><author>Ivins, E R</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal and interannual global surface mass variations from multisatellite geodetic data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><pages>B09401</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>B9</issue><keywords><keyword>deformation</keyword><keyword>earth</keyword><keyword>field</keyword><keyword>geocenter variations</keyword><keyword>gps data</keyword><keyword>motion</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>system</keyword><keyword>time-variable gravity</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005jb004100</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wu, X.

The estimates are derived by inverting GPS displacement series measured at roughly 450 continuously tracking sites and ocean bottom pressure (OBP) estimates of a data assimilated ocean circulation model from 1993 to 2004. The inversion uses a hybrid estimator after singular value decomposition of the normalized measurement equations with reduced reliance on a priori spectral information. The results are then compared and combined with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE) gravity data to provide enhanced spectral and geographic coverage. High fidelity degree-1 surface mass variation coefficients are recovered, corresponding to equivalent geocenter motion with better than 0.5 mm annual amplitude precisions in all three components. A clear annual surface mass cycle occurs in both GPS/OBP- and GRACE-derived results. There is very good agreement among the low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients and in global geographic pattern but with significant regional differences in amplitudes. Annual variations of average mass over the global oceans, Antarctica, and Greenland are then derived. Total surface mass over both Antarctica and Greenland peak in their respective summers due to increased atmospheric mass. Large interannual variations have also been found involving several continents in the 11-year GPS/OBP solution. The patterns of variation suggest that the recent satellite laser ranging (SLR) observation of a reversal in trend of the Earth's oblateness may be largely an interannual surface mass cycle with considerable contribution from the northern continents.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ellsworth, David</author><author>Green, Bryan</author><author>Henze, Chris</author><author>Moran, Patrick</author><author>Sandstrom, Timothy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Concurrent Visualization in a Production Supercomputing Environment</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</full-title></periodical><pages>997-1004</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/tvcg.2006.128</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ellsworth, D., B.

Conventional procedures to estimate entrainment heat advection often do not permit the closure of heat and temperature budgets because of inaccuracies in its formulation. In this study a rigorous approach to evaluate the effect of entrainment using the output of a general circulation model ( GCM) that does not have an explicit prognostic mixed layer model is described. The integral elements of the evaluation are 1) the rigorous estimates of the temperature difference between mixed layer water and entrained water at each horizontal grid point, 2) the formulation of the temperature difference such that the budget closes over a volume greater than one horizontal grid point, and 3) the apparent warming of the mixed layer during the mixed layer shoaling to account for the weak vertical temperature gradient within the mixed layer. This evaluation of entrainment heat advection is compared with the estimates by other commonly used ad hoc formulations by applying them in three regions: the north-central Pacific, the Kuroshio Extension, and the Nino-3 areas in the tropical Pacific. In all three areas the imbalance in the mixed layer temperature budget by the ad hoc estimates is significant, reaching a maximum of about 4 K yr(-1).</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Ponte, R M</author><author>Evangelinos, C</author><author>Forget, G</author><author>Mazloff, M</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Vinogradov, S</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining Altimetric and All Other Data with a General Circulation Model</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 15 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry Symposium</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 15 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry Symposium</full-title></periodical><volume>SP-614</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>Venice, 13-18 March 2006</pub-location><publisher>ESA Special Publication SP-614</publisher><notes>Heimbach, P., Ponte, R.

The empirical estimates of non-tidal signal from TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) and JASON-1 deviate from barotropic signals observed by OBP recorders, which can be attributed to baroclinic component in the altimeter data. We also compared the non-tidal barotropic signal derived from the observation with those from ECCO model (wind-driven) and Kyushu University model (pressure-driven). The comparison indicates that the pressure-driven model increases explained variance and it is suggested to combine the wind-driven model and the pressure-driven model in order to describe non-tidal ocean mass variability in particular at period shorter than 30 days.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, Detlef</author><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Ueyoshi, Kyozo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal Changes in Ocean Eddy Transports</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>543-550</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation models</keyword><keyword>energy</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO2858.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., C.

Making the approximation that the variability reflects primarily eddy motions, a time-mean, but spatially varying, eddy mixing coefficient is then estimated along with its changes over the last decade. With a record length more than 2 times that previously available, the time-mean variability kinetic energy K, is statistically more reliable and smoother in its spatial pattern. Minimum values of K-E are present in the subpolar North Pacific Ocean and in the eastern South Pacific (both less than 100 cm(2) s(-2)). in contrast to the North Pacific, the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean shows relatively enhanced K,. Eddy kinetic energy and eddy mixing appear to have declined during the last decade over large parts of the western Pacific Ocean, in some regions by as much as 50% of the time-mean value. Increased eddy variability can be found in the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream regions, as well as in the Agulhas region, east of Australia, and at several locations along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Somewhat enhanced eddy variability and eddy mixing are also apparent in the eastern tropical Pacific. A numerical simulation of the ocean circulation at 1 degrees spatial resolution over a 10-yr period suggests that variations in eddy mixing of this order of magnitude measurably affect the deep temperature field in the vicinity of permanent frontal structures on a time scale of less than 4 yr. The meridional overturning circulation also reacts on these time scales. If persistent over longer periods in the ocean, these effects would be important for climate simulations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Altimetry: Past, Present, and Future</title><secondary-title>15 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry Symposium</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>15 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry Symposium</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>Venice, 13-18 March 2006</pub-location><publisher>ESA Special Publication SP-614</publisher><notes>Wunsch, C., 2006: Altimetry: Past, Present, and Future. 15 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry Symposium, Venice, 13-18 March 2006, ESA Special Publication SP-614.</notes><research-notes>Wunsch, C., 2006: Altimetry: Past, Present, and Future. 15 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry Symposium, Venice, 13-18 March 2006, ESA Special Publication SP-614.</research-notes><urls/></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Douglass, Elizabeth</author><author>Roemmich, Dean</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual variability in northeast Pacific circulation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>C04001</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>C4</issue><keywords><keyword>4255 Numerical modeling</keyword><keyword>4262 Ocean observing systems</keyword><keyword>4275 Remote sensing and electromagnetic processes</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>model-data comparison</keyword><keyword>northeast Pacific</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005JC003015</electronic-resource-num><notes>Douglass, E., D.

XBT temperature profiles with high spatial resolution are available in the eastern North Pacific along two repeated transects. These ship tracks, along with the coast of North America, define a closed “box” which is used to study the time-mean circulation and its variability on interannual timescales. Geostrophic velocities from XBT data are compared with geostrophic velocities from model output as well as the full model velocity fields. Correlations in variability on interannual timescales between transport in the subpolar gyre and in the subtropical gyre are present in both model output and data. The nature of the variability, and its relation to the changes of the strength of the North Pacific Current (NPC), which supplies the water for both gyres, are explored. Interannual variability in gyre transport is found to be related to both the bifurcation of the NPC, resulting in an anticorrelation in transport between the two gyres, and to variations in NPC strength, resulting in simultaneous changes in the two gyres. The dominant signal is found to be a long-term increase in the NPC, which results in a strengthening of the subtropical gyre. Possible connections with local-scale wind stress changes and with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation phenomenon are also explored.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krakauer, Nir Y</author><author>Randerson, James T</author><author>Primeau, FranÇOis W</author><author>Gruber, Nicolas</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carbon isotope evidence for the latitudinal distribution and wind speed dependence of the air–sea gas transfer velocity</title><secondary-title>Tellus B</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tellus B</full-title></periodical><pages>390-417</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><publisher>Blackwell Publishing Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1600-0889.2006.00223.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Krakauer, N.

Here, we use oceanic and atmospheric observations of 14C and 13C to constrain the global mean gas transfer velocity as well as the exponent of its wind speed dependence, utilizing the distinct signatures left by the air–sea exchange of 14CO2 and 13CO2. While the atmosphere and ocean inventories of 14CO2 and 13CO2 constrain the mean gas transfer velocity, the latitudinal pattern in the atmospheric and oceanic 14C and 13C distributions contain information about the wind speed dependence. We computed the uptake of bomb 14C by the ocean for different transfer velocity patterns using pulse response functions from an ocean general circulation model, and evaluated the match between the predicted bomb 14C concentrations and observationally based estimates for the 1970s–1990s. Using a wind speed climatology based on satellite measurements, we solved either for the best-fit global relationship between gas exchange and mean wind speed or for the mean gas transfer velocity over each of 11 ocean regions. We also compared the predicted consequences of different gas exchange relationships on the rate of change and interhemisphere gradient of 14C in atmospheric CO2 with tree-ring and atmospheric measurements. Our results suggest that globally, the dependence of the air–sea gas transfer velocity on wind speed is close to linear, with an exponent of 0.5 ± 0.4, and that the global mean gas transfer velocity at a Schmidt number of 660 is 20 ± 3 cm/hr, similar to the results of previous analyses. We find that the air–sea flux of 13C estimated from atmosphere and ocean observations also suggests a lower than quadratic dependence of gas exchange on wind speed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponte, Rui M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic Response to Surface Loading Effects Neglected in Volume-Conserving Models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>426-434</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO2843.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ponte, R.

A similar problem exists with the representation of volume changes implied by surface heat fluxes. Under the assumption of an equilibrium response, such surface loads merely lead to spatially uniform sea level fluctuations, which carry no dynamical significance. A barotropic model forced by realistic freshwater fluxes is used to test the validity of the equilibrium assumption on seasonal to daily time scales. The simulated nonequilibrium signals have amplitudes much weaker than those of the forcing, with standard deviations well below 1 mm over most of the deep ocean. Larger values (up to ∼1 cm) can be found in shallow and semienclosed coastal areas, where the equilibrium assumption can lead to substantial errors even at monthly and longer time scales. Forcing by mean seasonal river runoff yields similar results, and heat flux effects lead to weaker nonequilibrium signals. In contrast, nonequilibrium signals driven by atmospheric pressure loading are at least an order of magnitude larger than those forced by freshwater fluxes. The exceptions occur for some shallow, coastal regions in the Tropics and at the longest time scales, in general, where forcing by freshwater flux is much stronger than by pressure.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferreira, D</author><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Formulation and implementation of a “residual-mean” ocean circulation model</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>86-107</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Coarse-resolution ocean model</keyword><keyword>Eddy parameterization</keyword><keyword>Residual-mean circulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2005.12.001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ferreira, D., and J.

In that framework, mean buoyancy is advected by the residual velocity (the sum of the Eulerian and eddy-induced velocities) and modified by a residual flux which accounts for the diabatic effects of mesoscale eddies. The residual velocity is obtained by stepping forward a residual-mean momentum equation in which eddy stresses appear as forcing terms. Study of the spatial distribution of eddy stresses, derived by using them as control parameters to “fit” the residual-mean model to observations, supports the idea that eddy stresses can be likened to a vertical down-gradient flux of momentum with a coefficient which is constant in the vertical. The residual eddy flux is set to zero in the ocean interior, where mesoscale eddies are assumed to be quasi-adiabatic, but is parameterized by a horizontal down-gradient diffusivity near the surface where eddies develop a diabatic component as they stir properties horizontally across steep isopycnals. The residual-mean model is implemented and tested in the MIT general circulation model. It is shown that the resulting model (1) has a climatology that is superior to that obtained using the Gent and McWilliams parameterization scheme with a spatially uniform diffusivity and (2) allows one to significantly reduce the (spurious) horizontal viscosity used in coarse-resolution GCMs.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, B N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A duality between forward and adjoint MPI communication routines</title><secondary-title>Comput.

One product comes from Scripps Institution of Oceanography (ECCO), and the other is the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) developed at University of Maryland. The results show that seasonal fluctuations in these two assimilated ocean angular momentum (OAM) time series agree better with each other along the Greenwich meridian than along the 90 degrees E meridian. Furthermore, annual OAM change for ECCO is much closer to non-atmospheric residual, than that for SODA. However, annual OAM change for SODA along the Greenwich meridian compares better than that for ECCO to non-atmospheric-hydrologic residual, in which annual and semi-annual signals of land hydrologic angular momentum (LHAM) of a climate model are considered. At the meantime, annual LHAM signals along the 90 degrees E meridian derived from the climate model and from the GRACE data are also compatible with each other. It is likely that ECCO overestimates the annual change along the 90 degrees E meridian according to the angular momentum conservation law in the Earth system. Consequently, the oceanic role in polar wobble should be further examined. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

An assessment of the ocean-generated magnetic fields and their detectability may be of importance for geomagnetism and oceanography. Motivated by the clear identification of ocean tidal signatures in the CHAMP magnetic field data we estimate the ocean magnetic signals of steady flow using a global 3-D EM numerical solution. The required velocity data are from the ECCO ocean circulation experiment and alternatively from the OCCAM model for higher resolution. We assume an Earth's conductivity model with a surface thin shell of variable conductance with a realistic ID mantle underneath. Simulations using both models predict an amplitude range of +/-2 nT at Swarm altitude (430 km). However at sea level, the higher resolution simulation predicts a higher strength of the magnetic field, as compared to the ECCO simulation. Besides the expected signatures of the global circulation patterns, we find significant seasonal variability of ocean magnetic signals in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans. Compared to seasonal variation, interannual variations produce weaker signals.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Takiguchi, Hiroshi</author><author>Fukuda, Yoichi</author><author>Otsubo, Toshimichi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mass-redistribution-induced crustal deformation of global satellite laser ranging stations due to non-tidal ocean and land water circulation</title><secondary-title>Earth, Planets and Space</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth, Planets and Space</full-title></periodical><pages>E13-E16</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>Satellite laser ranging</keyword><keyword>Topex/Poseidon</keyword><keyword>continental water load</keyword><keyword>crustal deformation</keyword><keyword>non-tidal ocean load</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>1343-8832</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/BF03353365</electronic-resource-num><notes>Takiguchi, H., Y.

The peak-to-peak displacements due to the CWL reach 3 mm for the horizontal components and 15 mm for the vertical component. We apply the time series of NTOL and CWL to precise SLR analysis. The LAGEOS orbit analysis reveals that the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model makes the root mean square (RMS) of the range residual 0.2% smaller, and that the CWL makes it 0.8% smaller, compared with the case where loading displacement is neglected. On the other hand, with the NTOL derived from Topex/Poseidon altimetry data, the SLR orbit fit is not improved.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated Decadal Changes in the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heat Flux 1993–2004</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2012-2024</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Annual variations</keyword><keyword>Heat flux</keyword><keyword>North Atlantic Ocean</keyword><keyword>O</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JPO2957.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., and P.

The least squares fit is both stable and adequately close to the data to make the analysis worthwhile. Changes over the 12 yr are spatially and temporally complex. A weak statistically significant trend is found in net North Atlantic volume flux above about 1200 m, which drops slightly (−0.19 ± 0.05 Sv yr−1; 1 Sv ≡ 106 m3 s−1) but with a corresponding strengthening of the outflow of North Atlantic Deep Water and inflow of abyssal waters. The slight associated trend in meridional heat flux is very small and not statistically significant. The month-to-month variability implies that single-section determinations of heat and volume flux are subject to serious aliasing errors.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Chassignet, EricP</author><author>Verron, Jacques</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>What is data assimilation really solving, and how is the calculation actually done?</title><secondary-title>Ocean Weather Forecasting: An Integrated View of Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Weather Forecasting: An Integrated View of Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>317-342</pages><keywords><keyword>Data assimilation</keyword><keyword>ECCO</keyword><keyword>Kalman filter</keyword><keyword>consistency</keyword><keyword>smoother</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><publisher>Springer Netherlands</publisher><isbn>1402039816</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/1-4020-4028-8_11</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., 2006: What is data assimilation really solving, and how is the calculation actually done?

The mathematical nature of the problem is examined and some of its common solutions are described, clarifying some of the implicit assumptions that underlie both problem and solution. For instance, Kalman filtering and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing can be identified as recursive least-squares inversions of the assimilation problem but of different parts of the problem. The temporal evolution of a filtered solution is not physically consistent, but that of a smoothed solution is. Understanding these characteristics is essential in effectively assimilating observations as well as in utilizing and further improving the assimilated solution. Practical steps in implementing a filtering and smoothing algorithm are illustrated by examples from the Consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO). © 2006 Springer.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ayoub, Nadia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of boundary values in a North Atlantic circulation model using an adjoint method</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>319-347</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Adjoint estimation method</keyword><keyword>MIT-GCM</keyword><keyword>North Atlantic</keyword><keyword>Open-boundary values estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2005.06.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Ayoub, N., 2006: Estimation of boundary values in a North Atlantic circulation model using an adjoint method.

In this preliminary feasibility study, the model is run during 1993 with a simplified vertical mixing physics. It is constrained by monthly SST fields, monthly climatological θ, S fields and TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetry. The adjoint model is built using automatic differentiation software. The method aims at bringing the model’s trajectory to consistency with data, by adjusting the initial θ, S fields, the time-varying atmospheric forcing fields and the time-varying open-boundary values. An originality of the work is the ‘nested approach’, which uses optimized fields from a global, coarser resolution model for the open-boundary conditions and for the prior estimates of the surface conditions adjustments. A solution is obtained after 75 iterations. This study shows that significant changes can be obtained on the open-boundary values, and that a general improvement in the circulation is achieved in the constrained solution, mainly in the Gulf Stream and equatorial regions. Changes at the open boundaries are characterized by a large temporal variability and small spatial scales. Large local adjustments are found close to the bottom and are likely unrealistic. There, the method tends to compensate for some model’s deficiencies by computing large corrections on the open-boundary values. The analysis of the cost function gradients with respect to the controls allows us to explore the local consistency between the constraints from the different data sets. This study suggests that no fundamental difficulty emerges when constraining open-boundary values. Its extension to a longer run with complete mixing physics can be envisaged.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Jochum, Markus</author><author>Murtugudde, Raghu</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards the World Ocean Circulation Experiment and a Bit of Aftermath</title><secondary-title>Physical Oceanography: Developments Since 1950</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Physical Oceanography: Developments Since 1950</full-title></periodical><pages>181-201</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>New York, NY</pub-location><publisher>Springer New York</publisher><isbn>978-0-387-33152-2</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/0-387-33152-2_12</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2006: Towards the World Ocean Circulation Experiment and a Bit of Aftermath.

Steady-state sensitivities to diapycnal mixing, wind stress, freshwater, and heat forcing are examined. Three different, commonly used, boundary-forcing scenarios are studied, both with and without wind forcing. Almost identical circulation is achieved in each scenario, but the sensitivity patterns show major (quantitative and qualitative) differences. Sensitivities to surface forcing and diapycnal mixing are substantially larger under mixed boundary conditions, in which fluxes of freshwater and heat are supplemented by a temperature relaxation term or under flux boundary conditions, in which climatological fluxes alone drive the circulation, than under restoring boundary conditions. The sensitivity pattern to diapycnal mixing, which peaks in the Tropics is similar both with and without wind forcing. Wind does, however, increase the sensitivity to diapycnal mixing in the regions of Ekman upwelling and decreases it in the regions of Ekman downwelling. Wind stress in the Southern Oceans plays a crucial role in restoring boundary conditions, but the effect is largely absent under mixed or flux boundary conditions. The results highlight how critical a careful formulation of the surface forcing terms is to ensuring a proper response to changes in forcing in ocean models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwok, R.</author><author>Cunningham, G.

This analysis includes data from six surveys. At the large scale the response of the ice-covered ocean to atmospheric loading is near ideal (i.e., approximately −1 cm/hPa). After removal of the inverted barometer effects and best available geoid the elevation signal is still dominated by unresolved geoid residuals (∼0.4 m) that can be seen in the similarity of the remaining spatial patterns. Seasonal differences in elevations over multiyear ice are consistent with snow depth climatology; the broad differential spatial patterns are indicative of interannual differences in multiyear ice coverage associated with advection. Patterns in the derived surface roughness fields correspond to the seasonal and perennial ice zones seen in QuikSCAT data. At the small scale, near-coincident RADARSAT imagery provides a spatial context for understanding the signature of the observed elevations, waveforms, and reflectivity, in particular, those associated with thin ice, open water, multiyear ice, and ridges. The precision of the elevation estimates measured over relatively flat sea ice, identified in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, is ∼2 cm. The unambiguous identification of ridged areas in coupled ICESat/RADARSAT analysis could be used to enhance the utility of SAR imagery for examining ridge distributions. Over a 20 day period we monitored the evolution of the reflectivity of a newly opened lead. The steep increase in reflectivity due to snow coverage suggests that dips in ICESat reflectivity are likely areas of thin ice and could serve as a basis for selection of tie points for use as sea level reference. Identification of these tie points is crucial for accurate estimation of sea ice freeboard.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mazloff, Matthew R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Production and analysis of a Southern Ocean state estimate</title><secondary-title>Thesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Thesis</full-title></periodical><pages>106</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>Woods Hole, MA</pub-location><publisher>Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1575/1912/1282</electronic-resource-num><notes>Mazloff, M.

The grids are composed from one or more logically rectangular regions on the surface of a sphere. Within each region grid lines are isocontours of Laplace equation solutions. A color- ing scheme tracks isocontours across logically rectangular regions. This scheme ensures that, subject to certain symmetry constraints, closed paths spanning multiple regions are C0 con- tinuous. When combined with domain decomposition techniques, this approach can be used to efficiently grid many useful domains including the entire surface of a planet or sub-regions such as ocean basins. The approach offers many practical benefits for existing geophysical fluid flow and transport models. Example grids and applications using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model are presented.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoteit, Ibrahim</author><author>Köhl, Armin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficiency of reduced-order, time-dependent adjoint data assimilation approaches</title><secondary-title>Journal of Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>539-550</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>4DVAR</keyword><keyword>Adjoint method</keyword><keyword>Data assimilation</keyword><keyword>EOFs</keyword><keyword>Order reduction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>0916-8370</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10872-006-0074-2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hoteit, I., &amp;amp; Köhl, A.

To improve the convergence rate of an optimization, reduced-order optimization methods that reduce the size of the control vector by projecting it onto a limited number of basis functions were suggested. In this paper, we show that such order reduction can indeed speed up the initial convergence rate of an assimilation effort in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic using in situ and satellite data as constraints. However, an improved performance of the optimization was only obtained with a hybrid approach where the optimization is started in a reduced subspace but is continued subsequently using the full control space. In such an experiment about 50% of the computational cost can be saved as compared to the optimization in the full control space. Although several order-reduction approaches seem feasible, the best result was obtained by projecting the control vector onto Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) computed from a set of adjusted control vectors estimated previously from an optimization using the same model configuration.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Naumann, U</author><author>Utke, J</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Ozyurt, D</author><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Fagan, M</author><author>Tallent, N</author><author>Strout, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adjoint Code by Source Transformation with OpenAD/F</title><secondary-title>ECCOMAS CFD 2006: Proceedings of the European Conference on Computational Fluid Dynamics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECCOMAS CFD 2006: Proceedings of the European Conference on Computational Fluid Dynamics</full-title></periodical><issue>May</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><notes>Naumann, U., Utke, J., Heimbach, P., Hill, C., Ozyurt, D., Wunsch, C., … Strout, M.

The differences in mixed layer depth and sea surface temperature resulting from these experiments are examined, and the underlying physical processes are investigated. The 24 hourly subsampling not only reduces the high-frequency variability of the wind but also affects the annual mean wind because of aliasing. While the former effect largely impacts mid- to high-latitude oceans, the latter primarily affects tropical and coastal oceans. At mid- to high-latitude regions the subsampled wind results in a shallower mixed layer and higher sea surface temperature because of reduced vertical mixing associated with weaker high-frequency wind. In tropical and coastal regions, however, the change in upper ocean structure due to the wind subsampling is primarily caused by the difference in advection resulting from aliased annual mean wind, which varies with the subsampling time. The results of the study indicate a need for more frequent sampling of satellite wind measurement and have implications for data assimilation in terms of identifying the nature of model errors.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Lee, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Green's functions to calibrate an ocean general circulation model</title><secondary-title>Monthly Weather Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Monthly Weather Review</full-title></periodical><pages>1224-1240</pages><volume>133</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>boundary</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>fluxes</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>transports</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/Mwr2912.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Menemenlis, D., I.

The method is applied to an ocean GCM, resulting in substantial improvements of the solution relative to observations when compared to prior estimates: overall model bias and drift are reduced and there is a 10%-30% increase in explained variance. Within the context of this optimization, the following new estimates for commonly used ocean GCM parameters are obtained. Background vertical diffusivity is (15.1 +/- 0.1) X 10(-6) m(2) s(-2). Background vertical viscosity is (18 +/- 3) x 10(-6) m(2) s(-2). The critical bulk Richardson number, which sets boundary layer depth, is Ri(c), = 0.354 +/- 0.004. The threshold gradient Richardson number for shear instability vertical mixing is Rio = 0.699 +/- 0.008. The estimated isopycnal diffusivity coefficient ranges from 550 to 1350 m(2) s(-2), with the largest values occurring at depth in regions of increased mesoscale eddy activity. Surprisingly, the estimated isopycnal diffusivity exhibits a 5%-35% decrease near the surface. Improved estimates of initial and boundary conditions are also obtained. The above estimates are the backbone of a quasi-operational, global-ocean circulation analysis system.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, R E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intermediate-depth circulation of the Indian and South Pacific Oceans measured by autonomous floats</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>683-707</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>alace</keyword><keyword>flow patterns</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword><keyword>total geostrophic circulation</keyword><keyword>tracers</keyword><keyword>trajectories</keyword><keyword>transports</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>velocity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/jpo2702.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Davis, R.

Mean velocities, seasonal variability, and lateral eddy diffusivity from the resultant 2583 float-years of data are presented. Area averages, local function fits, and a novel application of objective mapping are used to estimate the mean circulation. Patterns of mean circulation resemble those at the surface in both basins. Well-developed subtropical gyres, twice as strong in the Indian Ocean as in the Pacific, feed western boundary currents. Tropical gyres are separated by eastward flow along the equator in both hemispheres of both basins, although the Indian subcontinent splits the north Indian tropical gyre. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and west wind drifts are prominent in both basins, generally tending slightly southward but deviating to the north behind the Del Cano, Kerguelen, and Campbell Plateaus and, of course, South America. Remarkably, the eastern boundaries of the southern subtropical gyres in all three basins apparently occur in the ocean interior, away from land. The Indian Ocean's subtropical gyre, and perhaps part of the South Atlantic's, reaches east to a retroflection just upstream of the Campbell Plateau south of New Zealand. Seasonal variability at 900 m is focused around the equator with weaker variability found near certain bathymetric features. There is a remarkable agreement between the observed seasonable variability and that predicted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)-Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) data-assimilating numerical model. Aside from seasonal effects, eddy variability is greatest along the equator, in tropical and subtropical western basins, and along the ACC. Integrals of velocity across regional passages (Tasman Sea, Mozambique Channel) provide useful reference for hydrographic analyses of transport. Across whole ocean basins, however, the uncertainty associated with the appropriate continuity relation for horizontal flow (e.g., geostrophy vs nondivergence) is comparable to the mean flow.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirose, Naoki</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Kim, Cheol-Ho</author><author>Yoon, Jong-Hwan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Numerical simulation and satellite altimeter data assimilation of the Japan Sea circulation</title><secondary-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1443-1463</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dsr2.2004.09.034</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hirose, N., I.

The simulated sea-level variabilities are interpreted in relation to the Tsushima Warm Current, the Polar Front, and the subpolar gyre. The simulated and assimilated estimates account for about 29% and 49% of the measured sea level variance, respectively, and the difference between the two is mostly attributed to mesoscale variability corrections. The formal error covariance and separate assimilation of the satellite altimeter data reveal the higher efficacy of the ERS data in detecting the mesoscale variability compared to the T/P data. The assimilation impact lasts for a few months, reflecting the long lifetime of the subpolar gyre and the mesoscale eddies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CLIMODE: A mode water dynamics experiment in support of CLIVAR</title><secondary-title>U.S. CLIVAR VariationsCLIVAR Variations</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>U.S. CLIVAR VariationsCLIVAR Variations</full-title></periodical><pages>8-14</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005GL022350.Mysak</electronic-resource-num><notes>Marshall, J., 2005: CLIMODE: A mode water dynamics experiment in support of CLIVAR.

Adjoint techniques are used to compute the three-dimensional eddy stress field that minimizes the departure of the coarse-resolution model from climatological observations of temperature. The resulting 3D maps of eddy stress and residual-mean circulation yield a wealth of information about the role of eddies in large-scale ocean circulation. In eddy-rich regions such as the Southern Ocean, the Kuroshio, and the Gulf Stream, eddy stresses have an amplitude comparable to the wind stress, of order 0.2 N m?2, and carry momentum from the surface down to the bottom, where they are balanced by mountain form drag. From the optimized eddy stress, 3D maps of horizontal eddy diffusivity ? are inferred. The diffusivities have a well-defined large-scale structure whose prominent features are 1) large values of ? (up to 4000 m2 s?1) in the western boundary currents and on the equatorial flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and 2) a surface intensification of ?, suggestive of a dependence on the stratification N?2. It is shown that implementation of an eddy parameterization scheme in which the eddy diffusivity has an N?2 dependence significantly improves the climatology of the ocean model state relative to that obtained using a spatially uniform diffusivity. A global ocean circulation model is formulated in terms of the ?residual mean? and used to study eddy?mean flow interaction. Adjoint techniques are used to compute the three-dimensional eddy stress field that minimizes the departure of the coarse-resolution model from climatological observations of temperature. The resulting 3D maps of eddy stress and residual-mean circulation yield a wealth of information about the role of eddies in large-scale ocean circulation. In eddy-rich regions such as the Southern Ocean, the Kuroshio, and the Gulf Stream, eddy stresses have an amplitude comparable to the wind stress, of order 0.2 N m?2, and carry momentum from the surface down to the bottom, where they are balanced by mountain form drag. From the optimized eddy stress, 3D maps of horizontal eddy diffusivity ? are inferred. The diffusivities have a well-defined large-scale structure whose prominent features are 1) large values of ? (up to 4000 m2 s?1) in the western boundary currents and on the equatorial flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and 2) a surface intensification of ?, suggestive of a dependence on the stratification N?2. It is shown that implementation of an eddy parameterization scheme in which the eddy diffusivity has an N?2 dependence significantly improves the climatology of the ocean model state relative to that obtained using a spatially uniform diffusivity.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, Patrick</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Giering, Ralf</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An efficient exact adjoint of the parallel MIT General Circulation Model, generated via automatic differentiation</title><secondary-title>Future Gener.

Not surprisingly, since decadal-scale variations in the length of day are caused mainly by interactions between the mantle and core, the effect of the atmosphere and oceans is found to be only about 14% of that observed. More surprisingly, it is found that the effect of atmospheric and oceanic processes on decadal-scale changes in polar motion is also only about 20% (x component) and 38% (y component) of that observed. Therefore redistribution of mass within the atmosphere and oceans does not appear to be the main cause of the Markowitz wobble. It is also found that on timescales between 10 days and 4 years the atmospheric and oceanic angular momentum series used here have very little skill in explaining Earth orientation variations before the mid to late 1970s. This is attributed to errors in both the Earth orientation observations prior to 1976 when measurements from the accurate space-geodetic techniques became available and to errors in the modeled atmospheric fields prior to 1979 when the satellite era of global weather observing systems began.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Glazman, Roman E</author><author>Golubev, Yury N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of the ocean-induced magnetic field predicted at sea surface and at satellite altitudes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>110</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>0619 Electromagnetic theory</keyword><keyword>0689 Wave propagation</keyword><keyword>1517 Magnetic anomalies: modeling and interpretati</keyword><keyword>1545 Spatial variations: all harmonics and anomali</keyword><keyword>4275 Remote sensing and electromagnetic processes</keyword><keyword>Earth's magnetic field</keyword><keyword>ocean induction</keyword><keyword>ocean remote sensing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005JC002926</electronic-resource-num><notes>Glazman, R.

Well-known difficulties of numerical solution of the governing equations are resolved by reducing the problem to an equation for the electric field potential, Φ, as opposed to a more conventional approach focused on the vertical jump, ψ, of the magnetic field potential across a combined ocean/marine-sediment-layer spherical shell. The present formulation permits using more realistic input data on ocean currents and ultimately yields much greater (by at least an order of magnitude) values of the magnetic field at sea surface than predicted in earlier studies. Such large values are comparable to, and in some cases exceed, magnetic field variations caused by lithospheric and ionospheric sources on monthly to interannual timescales. At the 400-km altitude (of CHAMP satellite), the field attains 6 nT. The model predictions show favorable comparisons with some in situ measurements as well as with Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite magnetometer data.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Total Meridional Heat Flux and Its Oceanic and Atmospheric Partition</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>4374-4380</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JCLI3539.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2005: The Total Meridional Heat Flux and Its Oceanic and Atmospheric Partition.

Reversing the conventional approach of computing the ocean as an atmospheric model residual is done to permit calculation of a preliminary uncertainty estimate for the atmospheric flux. The structure of the ERBE errors is itself an important uncertainty. Total energy transport is almost indistinguishable from a hemispherically antisymmetric analytic function, despite the great asymmetry of the oceanic heat fluxes. ERBE data appear sufficiently noisy so that a considerable range of atmospheric transports remains possible: the maximum atmospheric value lies between 3 and 5 PW in the Northern Hemisphere, at one standard deviation, although the values are sensitive to the noise assumptions made here. The Northern Hemisphere ocean and atmosphere carry comparable poleward heat fluxes to about 28°N where the oceanic flux drops rapidly, but does not actually vanish until the oceanic surface area goes to zero. Within the estimated error bars, there is a remarkable antisymmetry about the equator of the combined ocean and atmospheric transports, despite the marked oceanic transport asymmetry.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Y H</author><author>Chen, J L</author><author>Liao, X H</author><author>Wilson, C R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic excitations on polar motion: a cross comparison among models</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><pages>390-398</pages><volume>162</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>atmosphere</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>earths wobble</keyword><keyword>equations</keyword><keyword>excitation</keyword><keyword>momentum (OAM)</keyword><keyword>ocean general circulation model (OGCM)</keyword><keyword>oceanic angular</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>rotation</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>signals</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-246X.2005.02694.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhou, Y.

In this paper, we analyse and compare observed non-atmospheric polar motion excitations with oceanic angular momentum (OAM) variations determined from four OGCMs, which include the parallel ocean climate model (POCM), a barotropic ocean model (BOM), the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) non-data-assimilating model (ECCO-NDA) and the ECCO data-assimilating model (ECCO-DA). The data to be analysed span a 5-yr overlapped period from 1993 to 1997. At annual timescale, considerable discrepancies exist between POCM and the other three models, which result mainly from differences in annual components of the forcing wind fields. At semi-annual timescale, however, POCM shows better phase agreement with observed non-atmospheric polar motion excitation than the other three ocean models. At intraseasonal timescales, ECCO-DA yields better agreement with observations, and reduces the variance of non-atmospheric excitations by similar to 60 per cent, 10-20 per cent more than those explained by the other three models. However, at the very short periods of 4-20 days, the BOM estimates could explain about half of the observed variance, twice as much as that by ECCO-NDA, and also shows considerably better correlation with observations. Due to different modelling schemes and methods, significant discrepancies could arise with respect to the quality of modelling large-scale oceanic mass redistribution and current variation. A complete understanding of global oceanic contributions to polar motion excitation still remains a challenge.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thermohaline loops, Stommel box models, and the Sandstrom theorem</title><secondary-title>Tellus Series a-Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Tellus Series a-Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>84-99</pages><volume>57</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>boundary-condition</keyword><keyword>chaos</keyword><keyword>equilibria</keyword><keyword>flow</keyword><keyword>global ocean circulation</keyword><keyword>instability</keyword><keyword>stability</keyword><keyword>thermal-convection</keyword><keyword>thermosyphon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1600-0870.2005.00093.x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2005: Thermohaline loops, Stommel box models, and the Sandstrom theorem.

More generally, such a loop, when heated and cooled at the same geopotential, provides a simple example of the working of the Sandstrom theorem, with flow intensity capable of increasing or decreasing with growing diffusion. Stress dominates real oceanic flows, and its introduction into the purely thermally driven loop generates oscillations, multiple states, and instabilities at low diffusivity. When, within the Boussinesq approximation, salinity forcing and mixed boundary conditions are further introduced, an intricate pattern of response appears, dependent upon at least five non-dimensional parameters, including the time of onset of salinity forcing. The ability, in a one-dimensional loop, to produce such a rich array of dynamical behaviors, dependent in detail upon the problem parameters, suggests that in the absence of any general results relating one- to three-dimensional fluid flows, identification of the time-dependent behavior of a GCM with that of the one-dimensional loop Stommel models should be regarded as still primarily speculation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Hill, Christopher N.</author><author>Adcroft, Alistair J.</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Cheng, B</author><author>Ciotti, B</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Henze, C</author><author>Köhl, A</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Taft, J</author><author>Zhang, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NASA supercomputer improves prospects for ocean climate research</title><secondary-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union</full-title></periodical><pages>89-96</pages><volume>86</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>4215 Climate and interannual variability</keyword><keyword>4532 General circulation</keyword><keyword>4540 Ice mechanics and air/sea/ice exchange proces</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005EO090002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Menemenlis, D., Hill, C.

Here an attempt to estimate geographically varying fields of horizontal and vertical viscosity and diffusivity within a 9-yr-long estimation procedure is presented. The estimated coefficients are highly efficient in preserving watermass characteristics and frontal structures by reducing the model temperature and salinity drift, especially around the Southern Ocean. The estimated mean circulation results in stronger transports of western boundary currents and of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Moreover, an increase of about 10% in the strength of the meridional overturning circulation and in the poleward heat transport can be found. Estimated changes in the horizontal mixing coefficients seem to agree with the notion that diapycnal mixing is superfically high with Laplacian mixing formulations, especially close to frontal structures in the ocean. In comparison with adjustments in tracer diffusivities (vertically and horizontally), adjustments of viscosity coefficients are fairly minor outside lateral boundary regions, suggesting that state estimation attempts might be most successful in providing enhanced insight into tracer mixing.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoteit, I.</author><author>Cornuelle, B.</author><author>Köhl, A.</author><author>Stammer, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Treating strong adjoint sensitivities in tropical eddy-permitting variational data assimilation</title><secondary-title>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>3659-3682</pages><volume>131</volume><issue>613</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1256/qj.05.97</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hoteit, I., Cornuelle, B., Köhl, A., &amp;amp; Stammer, D.

For climate dynamics analysis, what is required is a synthesis of all available observations over the last several decades with the best possible numerical model. Rigorous low-resolution estimates of ocean circulation are already possible using the existing data base and modeling capability. But these low-resolution estimates lack the ability to resolve many small-scale oceanic processes, for example, flow over narrow sills, western boundary currents, regions of deep convection, and eddies, that are important both for climate studies and for operational applications. I will discuss four recent advances that bring rigorous eddy-permitting estimates of the global ocean and sea-ice circulations within reach: 1) the configuration of an efficient eddy-permitting global-ocean and sea-ice model that achieves a throughput approaching ten years of model integration per day of computation, 2) the demonstration that boundary conditions estimated at coarse resolution have some skill when applied to an eddy-permitting model, 3) the development of an inexpensive yet effective methodology for calibrating model parameters and for blending estimates from different solutions and data products, and 4) a hierarchical Kalman filter that can estimate model uncertainties commensurate with available degrees of freedom in observations and the model. This is a contribution of the consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) and of the Arctic Sea-ice Ocean Reanalysis (ASOR) project.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mechoso, Carlos R</author><author>Cazes-Boezio, Gabriel</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Experimental ENSO predictions by the UCLA atmospheric GCM coupled to the MIT and POP Oceanic GCMs using the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the NASA Earth Science Technology Conference 2005</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the NASA Earth Science Technology Conference 2005</full-title></periodical><pages>1-5</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><pub-location>College Park, MD</pub-location><notes>Mechoso, C.

An important paleoclimatic question is to what extent lowered sea level at the Last Glacial Maximum effected the Indonesian Throughflow by restricting the gateways aperture. In this study, a regional dynamics of the Indonesian Throughflow are analysed for present- day and Last Glacial Maximum conditions. The focus of the study is on the impact of changes in Indonesian Gateways configuration on ocean circulation and distribution of marine organisms. A high resolution regional ocean model with seasonal forcing is used to simulate mean climatic circulation through the Indonesian Gateways. During the Last Glacial Maximum, both bathymetry and climate conditions were different. Relative importance of individual effects is investigated by separately testing the sensitivity of the ITF volume and heat transport to the sea level lowering and to the glacial climate conditions. The closure of the main passages is expected to reduce mean ITF transport during the glacial period. However, model results show that reduction in the glacial sea level of 120 m does not seem to be sufficient to severely block the flow within the Makassar Strait as the main passage of the Throughflow. An important impact of topographic changes is found in the vertical profile of the flow. Reduction in sill depth and absence of low buoyancy surface waters due to the exposure of shelf area lead to intensification of surface flow within Makassar Strait. Moreover, the seasonality of the surface flow is changed compared to the present-day. Both effects might have significant impact on the heat transport towards the Indian Ocean. A strong impact of individual passages on ITF profile and seasonal variability emphasis the role of Indonesian Gateways on modulating the water masses exchange between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. However, the intensity of the Throughflow seems to be highly dependant on the boundary conditions. Glacial climate conditions lead to reduction in ITF transport which might be related to several factors out of scope of regional dynamics. Such factors could include glacial changes in wind stress over Pacific, changes in density gradient between Pacific and Indian Ocean or overall El- Niño conditions over the tropical Pacific. In addition, by calculating Lagrangian trajectories, main pathways, velocities of propagation and probabilities of exchange of marine biota between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean can be assessed. The developed patterns of distribution can be in the future compared with sedimentological evidence from the region.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, J.L.</author><author>Wilson, C.R.</author><author>Tapley, B.D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual variability of low-degree gravitational change, 1980-2002</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geodesy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geodesy</full-title></periodical><pages>535-543</pages><volume>78</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00190-004-0417-y</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chen, J.

Results are compared with estimates obtained in a traditional way from along-track SSH data at crossover points and with in situ, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements obtained on board the VOS Oleander along a nominal path connecting Bermuda with the U.S. mainland. Agreements with the Oleander data are reasonable when simultaneous (in space and time) sampling is available. However, amplitudes of parallel-track geostrophic velocity variances are about 25% lower as compared to Oleander measurements which represent geostrophic and ageostrophic flow components. Estimates of velocity variances show clear signs of an anisotropic eddy field in the vicinity of all major current systems. At the same time estimates of Reynolds stresses and eddy momentum fluxes show a convergence of eddy momentum in all those regions, suggesting a forcing of the mean flow by the eddy field there.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reddy, P R C</author><author>Salvekar, P S</author><author>Deo, A A</author><author>Ganer, D W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Westward propagating twin gyres in the equatorial Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>31</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>rossby waves</keyword><keyword>somali current</keyword><keyword>southwest monsoon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003gl018615</electronic-resource-num><notes>Reddy, P.

The two simulations differ in their initial hydrographic conditions and surface wind and buoyancy forcing. The constrained simulation obtains optimal initial condition and surface forcing through assimilating observational data using the model's adjoint, whereas the unconstrained simulation uses Levitus climatological conditions for initialization and is driven by NCEP - NCAR reanalysis forcing, plus restoring to the monthly surface temperature and salinity climatological conditions. The goal is to examine the dynamics that sets the time-mean circulation and to understand the differences between the constrained and unconstrained simulations. It is found that, similar to eddy-permitting simulations, the bottom pressure torque (BPT) in coarse-resolution models plays an important role in the western boundary currents and in the Southern Ocean, and largely balances the difference between wind stress curl and betaV for the depth-integrated flow. BPT is a controlling factor of the interior abyssal flow. The geostrophic vorticity relation holds in the interior basins in intermediate and deep layers and breaks down in the upper ocean toward the surface. In the upper layer of the interior basins, the model simulations show statistically significant deviation from the Sverdrup balance. In the subtropical gyre regions, the deviation from Sverdrup balance is confined to zonal bands that are balanced by the curls of lateral friction and nonlinear advection. The differences between the constrained and unconstrained simulations are significant in vorticity terms. The adjustment to Levitus hydrographic climatological data as the model's initial condition causes the most significant changes in BPT, which is the main reason for changes in abyssal flow. The analysis also points to needs for further improvement of models and controlling the influence of data errors in ocean state estimation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decadal weakening of the shallow overturning circulation in the South Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>31</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>arabian sea</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>transports</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>world ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004gl020884</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., 2004: Decadal weakening of the shallow overturning circulation in the South Indian Ocean.

A solution to the design problem is presented here in terms of optimal observations that emerge as singular vectors of the modified data resolution matrix. The actual computation is feasible only for scalar quantities and in the limit of large observational errors. Identical twin experiments performed in the framework of a 18 North Atlantic primitive equation model demonstrate that such optimal observations, when applied to determining the heat transport across the Greenland - Scotland ridge, perform significantly better than traditional section data. On seasonal to interannual time scales, optimal observations are located primarily along the continental shelf and information about heat transport, wind stress, and stratification is being communicated through boundary waves and advective processes. On time scales of about 1 month, sea surface height observations appear to be more efficient in reconstructing the cross-ridge heat transport than hydrographic observations. Optimal observations also provide a tool for understanding changes of ocean state associated with anomalies of integral quantities such as meridional heat transport.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, J.‐L.</author><author>Wilson, C R</author><author>Hu, X.‐G.</author><author>Zhou, Y.‐H.</author><author>Tapley, B D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic effects on polar motion determined from an ocean model and satellite altimetry: 1993–2001</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><volume>109</volume><issue>B2</issue><keywords><keyword>OGCM</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>satellite altimeter</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003JB002664</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chen, J. ‐L., C.

We examine oceanic contribution to polar motion using estimates from a data?assimilating ocean general circulation model and satellite radar altimeter observations. The data include model estimates of variations in oceanic mass (OBP) and meridional and zonal velocities. Sea level anomalies from TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) satellite altimeter measurements and steric sea surface height changes deduced from the model are also used to estimate OBP effects. Estimated oceanic contributions from both the model and T/P show considerably better agreement with polar motion observations compared with results from previous studies. The improvement is particularly significant at intraseasonal timescales. Both OBP and ocean current variations provide important contributions to polar motion. At intraseasonal timescales the oceans appear to be a dominant contributor to residual polar motion not accounted for by the atmosphere. The oceans also play an important role in seasonal excitation. Combined OBP and ocean current contributions explain much of the residual semiannual variability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Losch, Martin</author><author>Adcroft, Alistair J.</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How sensitive are coarse general circulation models to fundamental approximations in the equations of motion?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>306-319</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>accurate</keyword><keyword>boussinesq approximation</keyword><keyword>conservation</keyword><keyword>fluid</keyword><keyword>free-surface</keyword><keyword>ocean models</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>representation</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(2004)034&lt;0306:hsacgc&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Losch, M., A.

Such a data source will prove valuable in state estimation and constraining general circulation models (GCMs) in general. However, conventional GCMs make the Boussinesq approximations, a consequence of which is that mass is not conserved. By use of the height-pressure coordinate isomorphism implemented in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITGCM), the impact of non-Boussinesq effects can be evaluated. Although implementing a non-Boussinesq model in pressure coordinates is relatively straightforward, making a direct comparison between height and pressure coordinate (i.e., Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq) models is not simple. However, a careful comparison of the height coordinate and the pressure coordinate solutions ensures that only non-Boussinesq effects can be responsible for the observed differences. As a yardstick, these differences are also compared with those between the Boussinesq hydrostatic and models in which the hydrostatic approximation has been relaxed, another approximation commonly made in GCMs. Model errors (differences) caused by the Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations are demonstrated to be of comparable magnitude. Differences induced by small changes in subgrid-scale parameterizations are at least as large. Therefore, non-Boussinesq and nonhydrostatic effects are most likely negligible with respect to other model uncertainties. However, because there is no additional cost incurred in using a pressure coordinate model, it is argued that non-Boussinesq modeling is preferable simply for tidiness. It is also concluded that even coarse-resolution GCMs can be sensitive to small perturbations in the dynamical equations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Ueyoshi, K</author><author>Kohl, A</author><author>Large, W G</author><author>Josey, S A</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating air-sea fluxes of heat, freshwater, and momentum through global ocean data assimilation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>109</volume><issue>C5</issue><keywords><keyword>air-sea fluxes</keyword><keyword>atmosphere</keyword><keyword>bulk parameterization</keyword><keyword>construction</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>layer</keyword><keyword>ncep</keyword><keyword>ocean synthesis</keyword><keyword>reanalyses</keyword><keyword>reanalysis project</keyword><keyword>satellite measurements</keyword><keyword>surface temperature</keyword><keyword>tropical ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003jc002082</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., K.

During the state estimation procedure, surface fluxes are adjusted together with initial temperature and salinity conditions so that the model simulation becomes consistent with ocean observations. Independent estimates of the adjustments from bulk formula and regional field observations are also employed to evaluate the results. Buoyancy flux adjustments are found to be within the crude prior error bars on these fields. Outside the boundary current regions, they are consistent with known large-scale deficiencies in the NCEP products. Wind stress adjustments are also everywhere within the prior error bars, but exhibit regional small-scale features that reflect ocean model failures to resolve intense boundary currents. On large scales, the inferred adjustments to NCEP wind stress fields are consistent with inferences made from satellite wind stress measurements. Further improvements in the surface flux estimates obtained through state estimation procedures are anticipated as the estimation procedure becomes more complete by including the use of improved prior error covariance information, and as the ocean model becomes more skillful, for example, in simulating boundary currents by increasing its resolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dommenget, D</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing ENSO simulations and predictions using adjoint ocean state estimation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>4301-4315</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>22</issue><keywords><keyword>atmosphere model</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>hybrid coupled</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>sea-surface temperature</keyword><keyword>system</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/3211.1</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dommenget, D., and D.

The skill of the 12-month lead SST forecast in the equatorial Pacific is comparable in both approaches. The optimization appears to have better skill in the SST anomaly correlations, suggesting that the initial ocean conditions and forcing corrections calculated by the ocean-state estimation do have a positive impact on the predictive skill.

The global variability in the air-sea flux of carbon (+/-0.5 x 10(15) grams Carbon yr(-1) (PgC yr(-1))) is forced by changes of DeltapCO(2) and wind speeds related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle in the equatorial Pacific. In contrast the air-sea O-2 flux is controlled by two regions: the equatorial Pacific and North Atlantic. The model captures much of the interannual variability of the CO2 flux observed at Bermuda, with some correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. However, basin-scale air-sea CO2 flux anomalies are not correlated with the NAO due to a rapid neutralization of entrained DIC anomalies by biological uptake and export production in the subpolar gyre. CO2 flux variability estimates from our ocean model and the mean atmospheric inversion results of Bousquet et al. [2000] are in broad agreement in the equatorial Pacific, but not in the North Atlantic. This model suggests that the projection of air-sea flux anomalies onto the large-scale, mean air-sea flux pattern in atmospheric inversions may lead to an overestimate of the flux variability in the extra-tropics where the patterns of variability do not correspond to those of the mean flux.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author><author>Adcroft, Alistair J.</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Marshall, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conservation of properties in a free-surface model</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>221-244</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation models</keyword><keyword>free-surface</keyword><keyword>general</keyword><keyword>semtner ocean model</keyword><keyword>shallow water equations</keyword><keyword>tracer conservation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s1463-5003(03)00009-x</electronic-resource-num><notes>Campin, J.

However, NLFS does not guarantee exact conservation unless special care is taken in the implementation, and in particular the time stepping scheme, as pointed out by Griffies et al. (Monthly Weather Rev. 129 (2001) 1081). This paper presents a general method to implement a NLFS in a conservative way, using an implicit free surface formulation. Details are provided for two tracer time stepping schemes, both second order in time and space: a two time-level scheme, such as Lax-Wendroff scheme, guarantees exact tracer conservation; a three time-level scheme such as the Adams-Bashforth II requires further adaptations to achieve exact local conservation and accurate global conservation preventing long term drift of the model tracer content. No compromise is required between local and global conservation since the method accurately conserves any tracer. In addition to the commonly used backward time stepping, the implicit free surface formulation also offers the option of a Crank-Nickelson time stepping which conserves the energy. The methods are tested in idealized experiments designed to emphasize problems of tracer and energy conservation. The tests show the ability of the NLFS method to conserve tracers, in contrast to the linear free-surface formulation. At test of energy conservation reveals that free-surface backward time-stepping strongly damps the solution. In contrast, Crank-Nickelson time stepping exactly conserves energy in the pure linear case and confirms the NLFS improvement relative to the linear free-surface when momentum advection is included.

Here the relative contribution of upper atmospheric winds, surface pressure, oceanic currents, and ocean-bottom pressure to changing the length-of-day during 1980 - 2000 is evaluated using estimates of atmospheric angular momentum from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/ National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis project, estimates of the angular momentum of the zonal winds in the upper atmosphere from the United Kingdom Meteorological Office, and estimates of oceanic angular momentum from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean consortium's simulation of the general circulation of the oceans. On intraseasonal timescales, atmospheric surface pressure, oceanic currents, and ocean-bottom pressure are found to be about equally important in causing the length-of-day to change, while upper atmospheric winds are found to be less important than these mechanisms. On seasonal timescales, the upper atmospheric winds are more important than the sum of currents and bottom pressure in causing the length-of-day to change and, except at the annual frequency, are even more important than surface pressure changes. On interannual timescales, oceanic currents and ocean-bottom pressure are found to be only marginally effective in causing the length-of-day to change.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Worcester, Peter F</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce D</author><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Dzieciuch, Matthew A</author><author>Howe, Bruce M</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mercer, James A</author><author>Munk, Walter H</author><author>Spindel, Robert C</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author><author>Zarnetske, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ACOUSTIC REMOTE SENSING OF LARGE-SCALE TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY IN THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN</title><secondary-title>Gayana (Concepción)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gayana (Concepción)</full-title></periodical><pages>576-577</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4067/S0717-65382004000300047</electronic-resource-num><notes>Worcester, P.

These sensitivities are compared with those of spiciness, T - (beta/alpha) S, where alpha, beta are the thermal and haline expansion coefficients, respectively. High-sensitivity fields are candidates for providing the most powerful constraints in the corresponding inverse problems. In the dual (adjoint) solutions all three variables exhibit the major ventilation pathways and define the associated timescales in the model. Overall, however, spiciness shows the highest sensitivity to the flow field. In the North Atlantic Deep Water, sensitivities of CFC properties and spiciness to the isopycnal mixing and thickness diffusion are of the same order of magnitude. In the lower subtropical thermocline, sensitivities of CFC properties to the isopycnal mixing and thickness diffusion are higher. The utility of this sensitivity is undermined by the need to reconstruct their boundary conditions. Given the influence of T, S measurements on the density field, they produce the most powerful constraints on the model on the large scale. It still remains possible, however, that transient tracers can provide a larger relative information content concerning the mixing process between the near-surface boundary layer and the thermocline but dependent upon the ability to reconstruct accurate initial and boundary conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, S B</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 1997-1999 abrupt change of the upper ocean temperature in the north central Pacific</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>31</volume><issue>22</issue><keywords><keyword>america</keyword><keyword>anomalies</keyword><keyword>decadal climate variability</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>ecosystems</keyword><keyword>flux</keyword><keyword>heat-budget</keyword><keyword>model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004gl021142</electronic-resource-num><notes>Kim, S.

The finite-volume method naturally describes arbitrary grids, and use of the vector-invariant form of the momentum equations simplifies the generalization to arbitrary coordinates. Grids based on the expanded spherical cube of Rancic et al., which contain eight singular points, are used. At these singularities the grid is nonorthogonal. The combined use of vector-invariant equations and the finite-volume method is shown to avoid degeneracy at these singular points. The model is tested using experiments proposed by Williamson et al. and Held and Saurez. The atmospheric solutions are examined seeking evidence of the underlying grid in solutions and eddy statistics. A global ocean simulation is also conducted using the same code. The solutions prove to be accurate and free of artifacts arising from the cubic grid.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adcroft, Alistair J.</author><author>Campin, Jean-Michel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rescaled height coordinates for accurate representation of free-surface flows in ocean circulation models</title><secondary-title>Ocean Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ocean Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>269-284</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>cells</keyword><keyword>coordinate transformation</keyword><keyword>free</keyword><keyword>internal wave generation</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>numerical weather prediction</keyword><keyword>ocean model</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>schemes</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword><keyword>topography</keyword><keyword>vertical coordinate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ocemod.2003.09.003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Adcroft, A., and J.

We present a resealed height coordinate, which we call z*, that treats the time-dependent free surface as a coordinate surface. This coordinate is isomorphic with the atmospheric eta coordinate, sometimes known as the step-mountain coordinate. The z* coordinate has also been used in a coastal ocean model. However, unlike both these implementations, here we use the finite volume method within the z* coordinate framework, allowing an accurate representation of topography. The resulting scheme provides a very accurate representation of motions over steep topography in a three-dimensional general circulation model, even with fast and large amplitude free-surface variations.

Simulated passive tracers and their adjoint are employed to explicitly follow the circulation of specific water masses accounting for advective and diffusive effects and their time variabilities. The evolution of the forward passive tracer and adjoint passive tracer can be identified as describing where the tracer-tagged water mass goes and from where it comes, respectively. Over 10 years on average, water mass of the Nino-3 region can be traced back to eastern subtropical thermocline waters of the Northern (27%) and Southern Hemispheres (39%). The Nino-3 water subsequently returns to these subtropical latitudes in the upper ocean. In contrast to the hypothesized &quot;subtropical cell,'' however, this circulation is an open circuit with water returning to the western regions of the two hemispheres ( subtropical gyres) and to the Indian Ocean, instead of returning to its origins. The representative transit time scale from the subtropics to the Tropics is 10 15 yr. Temporal variability causes the tropical circulation inferred from a time-mean state to differ significantly from the average circulation. In particular, stirring due to nonseasonal, intra-annual variability significantly enhances the transport magnitude of the so-called interior pathways relative to that of the circuitous low-latitude western boundary pathways. Such short-circuit in the subtropical - tropical exchange may help better to explain tracer distributions, such as the observed midbasin tritium maximum in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Significant differences in circulation pathways are also identified that are associated with El Nino and La Nina events. The strength of the subtropical - tropical water mass exchange is estimated to have weakened during the 1990s.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zerbini, S</author><author>Matonti, F</author><author>Raicich, F</author><author>Richter, B</author><author>van Dam, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Observing and assessing nontidal ocean loading using ocean, continuous GPS and gravity data in the Adriatic area</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>31</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>deformation</keyword><keyword>displacements</keyword><keyword>earth</keyword><keyword>height</keyword><keyword>mass</keyword><keyword>redistribution</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>surface</keyword><keyword>system</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004gl021185</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zerbini, S., F.

A validation of the ECCO model is performed by comparing model estimates of sea-level anomalies from tide-gauges with TOPEX/POSEIDON data, and ECCO model estimates of bottom pressure with those derived from temperature and salinity observations. The amplitudes of the ECCO sea-level anomaly are found to be 1.4 times smaller than observations; bottom pressure is 2 times smaller. Using a Green's functions approach to determine elastic deformations, the ECCO ocean bottom pressure is used to estimate surface displacements at the GPS sites. Model results were compared with the height series and with the observed NTOL effect. The height series and the predicted NTOL are highly correlated at all four stations.

The streamline-averaged numerical model, which represents transport in the meridional plane, captures the observed distributions of CFC-11, bomb-Delta(14)C, and anthropogenic CO2. The model reproduces the observed relationship between CFC-11 and bomb-Delta(14)C and suggests that the upper branch of the residual overturning flow in the Southern Ocean is about 14 Sv, supporting previous inferences based on the observed buoyancy distribution and air-sea buoyancy fluxes. Scale analysis suggests that the limit of fast air-sea gas exchange is applicable to CFC-11, for which the surface concentration is close to equilibrium and cumulative ocean uptake is largely determined by physical transport processes. In the slow gas exchange limit, applicable to bomb-Delta(14)C, the surface concentration is far from equilibrium and the cumulative uptake is most sensitive to the parameterization of the gas transfer coefficient. Anthropogenic CO2 falls between those two limit cases and is sensitive to both transport processes and the gas transfer coefficient. Sensitivity studies using the streamline-averaged model suggest that uncertainties in air-sea buoyancy fluxes in current climatologies result in significant uncertainty in estimates of Southern Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 based on circulation and biogeochemistry models driven by, or brought into consistency with, the climatological fluxes. This uncertainty is sufficient to explain a significant amount of the spread in a recent model comparison study.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Tang, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temperature advection: Internal versus external processes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1936-1944</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>1997-98 el-nino</keyword><keyword>equatorial pacific</keyword><keyword>heat-budget</keyword><keyword>mechanisms</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(2004)034&lt;1936:Taivep&gt;2.0.Co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., I.

This product is often integrated spatially to infer temperature advection over a region. However, the contribution along an individual direction can be dominated by internal processes that redistribute heat within the domain but do not control the heat content of the domain. A new formulation of temperature advection is introduced to elucidate external heat source and sink that control the spatially averaged temperature. It is expressed as the advection of interfacial temperature relative to the spatially averaged temperature of the domain by inflow normal to the interface. It gives a total advection of temperature that is identical to the spatial integration of local temperature advection, yet the contributions along individual directions depict external processes. The differences between the two formulations are illustrated by analyzing zonal advection of near-surface temperature in the eastern equatorial Pacific during the 1997-98 El Nino and the subsequent La Nina by an ocean general circulation model. The new formulation highlights the advection of warmer water at the western side of the Nino-3 region into (out of) the region to create part of the warming (cooling) tendency during El Nino (La Nina). In contrast, the traditional formulation is dominated by the effect of tropical instability waves within the region that redistribute heat internally. The difference between the two formulations suggests a need for caution in discerning mechanisms controlling heat content of a region. Spatial integration of local temperature advection does not explain external processes that control a domain's heat content. The conclusion applies not only to the advection of oceanic temperature, but also to that of any property in any medium.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, O</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Lee, T</author><author>Johnson, G C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean T-S variations with El Nino</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>L04305</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>la-nina</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003gl019087</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wang, O., I.

In contrast to perturbation sensitivity experiments, the adjoint approach provides a computationally efficient way to characterize both temporal and spatial variations of sequestration efficiency and residence time for a complete global model domain. Sequestration efficiency ( the percentage of carbon injected at a continuous point source that remains in the ocean after an elapsed time), for injections at the base of the main thermocline ( similar to 900 m), is initially lowest in the North Atlantic basin ( except for regions of deep convection in the Labrador Sea) relative to the North Pacific. For injection periods of the order of a century or more, however, the model suggests that Pacific injection sites are generally less efficient for a constant rate injection source. The mean residence time ( defined as the average period that impulsively injected carbon from a particular point source remains within the ocean) is also evaluated and mapped. This measure also suggests that Atlantic sequestration is more efficient in the long term. Our calculations draw out the dual role of convective mixing, both exposing shallow sequestration sources to the atmosphere and also, in the subpolar Atlantic and Labrador Sea, feeding carbon from shallow injection sources into the deep circulation away from the atmosphere.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Howe, Bruce M.</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce D.</author><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Dzieciuch, Matthew A.</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mercer, James A.</author><author>Munk, Walter H.</author><author>Spindel, Robert C.</author><author>Stammer, Detlef</author><author>Worcester, Peter F.</author><author>Zarnetske, M.

Acoustic sources located off central California and north of Kauai transmitted to receivers distributed throughout the North Pacific from 1996 through 1999 during the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) project. The Kauai transmissions resumed in early 2002 and are now continuing as part of the North Pacific Acoustic Laboratory (NPAL) project; a six-year time series has been obtained so far. Even at long time and large spatial scales the ocean is highly variable. The paths from Kauai to California show a modest cooling trend (longer travel times) until the present time. A path to the northwest showed modest warming and a weak annual cycle from 1999 until early 2003, when a strong annual cycle returned. In retrospect, these changes stemmed from the warming of the central Pacific that occurred in this interval, possibly associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Comparisons between measured travel times and those predicted using ocean models, constrained by satellite altimeter and other data, show significant similarities and differences. Comparison between upper-ocean Argo profiling float temperatures and the acoustically measured temperature along one path illustrates the strength of the integral measurements, with substantially lower uncertainty. The acoustic data ultimately need to be combined with sea-surface height Argo float data to determine the complementarity of the various data types.

Observing the ocean is difficult owing to its turbulent nature and enormous range of energetic spatial scales. This project, building upon earlier experience, is establishing the means by which a quantitative description of the global ocean will be routinely and continuously available. The methodology employs state-of-the-art general circulation models, statistical estimation techniques, and the complete range of available oceanic observations including, particularly, global satellite data, as well as in situ observations of all kinds. The effort includes further demonstration of the practical utility of ocean observing systems through their use in important scientific goals.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biswas, Rupak</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scientific Applications of High-End Computing I</title></titles><periodical/><pages>21-32</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><pub-location>Baltimore, MD</pub-location><notes>Biswas, R.

The model is rooted in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and can include the non-hydrostatic terms that are important in mixing processes. In the hydrostatic limit, an isomorphism between height based-coordinates and pressure based-coordinates allows the same dynamical kernel to drive an atmospheric model. The model uses finite volume methods and orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in the horizontal that can accommodate novel spherical grids such as that based on the conformally expanded spherical cube. An adjoint of the model is maintained using automatic differentiation.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, J.

The focus is on the sensitivity of cross-ridge transports and the reaction of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean circulation to changes in wind stress and buoyancy forcing on seasonal to interannual timescales. A general relation between changes in wind stress or cross-ridge density contrasts and the overturning transport of Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas source water is established from a series of idealized experiments. The relation is used subsequently to interpret changes in an experiment over the years 1992-97 with realistic forcing. On seasonal and interannual timescales there is a clear correlation between heat flux and wind stress curl variability. The realistic model suggests a steady decrease in the strength of the cyclonic subpolar gyre of the North Atlantic with a corresponding decrease in heat transport during the 1990s.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gross, R S</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atmospheric and oceanic excitation of the Earth's wobbles during 1980-2000</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><volume>108</volume><issue>B8</issue><keywords><keyword>angular-momentum</keyword><keyword>atmospheric angular momentum</keyword><keyword>base-line interferometry</keyword><keyword>chandler wobble</keyword><keyword>chandler-wobble</keyword><keyword>earth rotation</keyword><keyword>gravitational-field</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>oceanic angular momentum</keyword><keyword>orientation</keyword><keyword>polar motion</keyword><keyword>polar motion excitation</keyword><keyword>rotation</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>short periodic variations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2002jb002143</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gross, R.

Here, the effectiveness of atmospheric and oceanic processes in exciting the Earth's wobbles during 1980-2000 is evaluated using estimates of atmospheric angular momentum from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis project and estimates of oceanic angular momentum from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium's simulation of the general circulation of the oceans. On intraseasonal timescales, atmospheric surface pressure changes are found to be the single most effective process exciting the Earth's wobbles, explaining about twice as much of the observed variance as do either atmospheric wind or ocean bottom pressure changes and nearly 4 times as much of the observed variance as do oceanic currents. However, on interannual timescales, ocean bottom pressure changes are found to be the single most effective process exciting the Earth's wobbles, explaining more than 5 times as much of the observed variance as do atmospheric wind and pressure changes combined, and more than twice as much of the observed variance as do oceanic currents. Within the Chandler band it is found that during 1980-2000 atmospheric and oceanic processes have enough power to excite the Chandler wobble and are significantly coherent with it. The single most important mechanism exciting the Chandler wobble is found to be ocean bottom pressure variations. Atmospheric and oceanic processes do not appear to have enough power to excite the Earth's wobbles to their observed levels on pentadal and longer timescales, although series longer than the 21-year long series used here need to be studied in order to obtain greater statistical significance of this result.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fieguth, P W</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Fukumori, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping and pseudoinverse algorithms for ocean data assimilation</title><secondary-title>Ieee Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ieee Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>43-51</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>altimeter data</keyword><keyword>circulation model</keyword><keyword>climatological models</keyword><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>extended kalman filter</keyword><keyword>interscale transforms</keyword><keyword>pseudoinverse methods</keyword><keyword>remote sensing</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>sparse pseudoinverses</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific-ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/Tgrs.2002.808058</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fieguth, P.

In such reduced-state filters, the measurement update takes place on a coarser grid than that of the general circulation model (GCM); therefore, these filters require mapping operators from the GCM grid to the reduced state and vice versa. The general requirements are that the state-reduction and interpolation operators be pseudoinverses of each other, that the coarse state define a closed dynamical system, that the mapping operations be insensitive to noise, and that they be appropriate for regions with irregular coastlines and bathymetry. In this paper, we describe three efficient algorithms for computing the pseudoinverse: a fast Fourier transform algorithm that serves for illustration purposes, an exact implicit method that is recommended for most applications, and an efficient iterative algorithm that can be used for the largest problems. The mapping performance of 11 interpolation kernels is evaluated. Surprisingly, common kernels such as bilinear, exponential, Gaussian, and sine perform only moderately well. We recommend instead three kernels, smooth, thin-plate, and optimal interpolation, which have superior properties. This study removes the computational bottleneck of mapping and pseudoinverse algorithms and makes possible the application of reduced-state filters to global problems at state-of-the-art resolutions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chao, B F</author><author>Au, A Y</author><author>Boy, J P</author><author>Cox, C M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time-variable gravity signal of an anomalous redistribution of water mass in the extratropic Pacific during 1998-2002</title><secondary-title>Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems</full-title></periodical><volume>4</volume><keywords><keyword>J(2) anomaly</keyword><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>distribution</keyword><keyword>earth rotation</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>extratropic Pacific</keyword><keyword>field</keyword><keyword>geodesy and gravity : ocean/earth/atmosphere inter</keyword><keyword>interdecadal variability</keyword><keyword>lageos</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>oceanography : general : climate and interannual v</keyword><keyword>oscillation</keyword><keyword>time-variable gravity</keyword><keyword>water mass</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2003gc000589</electronic-resource-num><notes>Chao, B.

Here we report that recent data show that J(2) has been rapidly returning toward &quot;normal'' (with PGR considered) since early 2001. In search of the geophysical and climatic causes for this &quot;1998-2002 J(2) anomaly,'' we report an oceanographic event that took place in the extratropic north and south Pacific basins that was found to match remarkably well with the time evolution of the anomaly. We examine the leading (nonseasonal, extratropic Pacific) Empirical Orthogonal Function/Principal Component modes in the sea-surface height (SSH) data from TOPEX/Poseidon, sea surface temperature (SST) data from the National Center for Environmental Predictions, and output fields of the Estimating the Circulation and the Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) ocean general circulation model (OGCM), including ocean bottom pressure (OBP) and temperature and salinity profiles. The phenomenon appears to be part of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and temporal correlations are made. However, quantitatively, the OBP field of the ECCO model predicts a J(2) anomaly that is smaller in magnitude than the observed by a factor of about 3. We discuss various possibilities for reconciling this discrepancy in terms of inadequacies of present OGCMs and considering other geophysical contributions; a complete resolution of the J(2) enigma awaits further studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, X W</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Constraining the North Atlantic circulation between 4.5 degrees S and 39.5 degrees N with transient tracer observations</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>108</volume><issue>C10</issue><keywords><keyword>adjoint model</keyword><keyword>age</keyword><keyword>antarctic bottom water</keyword><keyword>chlorofluorocarbon</keyword><keyword>fresh-water transports</keyword><keyword>heat</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>observations</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>rates</keyword><keyword>sea</keyword><keyword>state estimation</keyword><keyword>transient tracer</keyword><keyword>tritium</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2002jc001765</electronic-resource-num><notes>Li, X.

The method of Lagrange multipliers (adjoint) is used. Tracer distribution within the model ocean interior is primarily sensitive to the flux through the open northern boundary. This flux is determined by the estimation method and is found to deviate from the initial estimate significantly for all tracers. An attempt to carry the model domain to 78.5degreesN showed the GCM inadequacy, believed to be primarily a problem of spatial resolution, to compute the convective injection of tracer into the deep ocean. Any such errors persist throughout the tracer integration and corrupt all further tracer concentrations. In general, and consistent with earlier much simpler computations, uncertainties in surface and northern boundary conditions dominate the computed tracer concentrations. The final results here are improved estimates of the three-dimensional time histories of the tritium and CFCs and their boundary conditions over the model domain, with very little information available to constrain the GCM itself in the latitude band.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Legg, S</author><author>Adcroft, Alistair J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Internal wave breaking at concave and convex continental slopes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2224-2246</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>2 dimensions</keyword><keyword>deep-ocean</keyword><keyword>dissipation</keyword><keyword>finite topography</keyword><keyword>fluid</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>reflection</keyword><keyword>scattering</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(2003)033&lt;2224:iwbaca&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Legg, S., and A.

Previous analytic studies have suggested that shear enhancement is reduced at concave slopes as compared with convex and planar slopes near the critical angle. Here the internal wave reflection from concave and convex slopes that pass through the critical angle is investigated numerically using the nonhydrostatic Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm). Overturning, shear instability, and resultant mixing are examined. Results are compared with simulations of wave reflection from planar slopes with angles greater than, less than, and equal to the critical angle. In contrast to the analytic predictions, no reduction in mixing is found for the concave slope as compared with the other slopes. In all cases, stratification is eroded in a band above the slope, bounded at its outer edge by the internal wave characteristic. The difference between numerical and analytic results is caused by the nonlinearity of the numerical calculations, where the finite-amplitude flow leads to generation of upslope-propagating bores for a wide range of topographic slopes around the critical angle.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual-to-Decadal Variations of Tropical–Subtropical Exchange in the Pacific Ocean: Boundary versus Interior Pycnocline Transports</title><secondary-title>Journal of Climate</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Climate</full-title></periodical><pages>4022-4042</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>circulation</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>equatorial pacific</keyword><keyword>heat-content variability</keyword><keyword>indonesian throughflow</keyword><keyword>mindanao current</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>north pacific</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>water exchange</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016&lt;4022:IVOTEI&gt;2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., and I.

The analysis focuses on the variability of pycnocline transports through the western boundary and interior near 10degreesN and 10degreesS. In contrast to time-mean exchange, where boundary and interior pycnocline transports are both equatorward, the variations of boundary and interior pycnocline transports are found to be generally anticorrelated to each other. Moreover, the variation of the boundary pycnocline transport is smaller than that of the interior, again different from time-mean exchange, where the boundary transport at 10degreesN is substantially larger than that through the interior. Interannual variations of the boundary and interior transports are consistent with near-surface geostrophic flow inferred from sea level data. Interior pycnocline flow into the Tropics is weaker in the 1990s than that in the 1980s, in agreement with recent observations. However, approximately half of it is compensated by an opposite change in boundary flow at 10degreesN. The results indicate that the interior pathway is more important to interannual and decadal variability of tropical - subtropical exchange than the boundary pathway, despite a much larger time-mean transport of the western boundary current at 10degreesN. To a large extent, the counteracting tendency of the boundary and interior flow and the larger variation of the latter can be explained by the combined effect of variability in off-equatorial wind stress curl in the western Pacific and near-equatorial zonal wind stress. The former changes the strength of horizontal circulation and results in a variation of boundary pycnocline flow that is opposite in direction but comparable in magnitude to that of the interior pycnocline flow. The latter primarily affects the strength of the shallow meridional overturning circulation with net pycnocline flow ( mostly in the interior) opposing the surface Ekman flow. The covariability of these two forcings leads to an enhancement of interior transport. The relative variability of boundary and interior pycnocline flow is insensitive to whether the Indonesian Throughflow is present or not.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Losch, Martin</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bottom topography as a control variable in an ocean model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1685-1696</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>explorer goce mission</keyword><keyword>fluxes</keyword><keyword>general-circulation</keyword><keyword>gravity-field</keyword><keyword>impact</keyword><keyword>parameters</keyword><keyword>volume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0426(2003)020&lt;1685:btaacv&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Losch, M., and C.

Output from a data synthesis, or state estimation, method is used by which the model was forced to large-scale, time-varying global ocean data sets over 1993 through 2000. Time-mean horizontal transports, estimated from this fully time-dependent circulation, have converged with independent time-independent estimates from box inversions over most parts of the world ocean but especially in the southern hemisphere. However, heat transport estimates differ substantially in the North Atlantic where our estimates result in only 1/2 previous results. The models drift over the estimation period is consistent with observations from TOPEX/Poseidon in their spatial pattern, but smaller in their amplitudes by about a factor of 2. Associated temperature and salinity changes are complex, and both point toward air-sea interaction over water mass formation regions as the primary source for changes in the deep ocean. The estimated mean circulation around Australia involves a net volume transport of 11 Sv through the Indonesian Throughflow and the Mozambique Channel. In addition, we show that this flow regime exists on all timescales above 1 month, rendering the variability in the South Pacific strongly coupled to the Indian Ocean. Moreover, the dynamically consistent variations in the model show temporal variability of oceanic heat transports, heat storage, and atmospheric exchanges that are complex and with a strong dependence upon location, depth, and timescale. Our results demonstrate the great potential of an ocean state estimation system to provide a dynamical description of the time-dependent observed heat transport and heat content changes and their relation to air-sea interactions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author><author>Stammer, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>III: OCEAN CIRCULATION: Global Ocean Data Assimilation and Geoid Measurements</title><secondary-title>Space Science Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Space Science Reviews</full-title></periodical><pages>147-162</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>1/2</issue><keywords><keyword>atlantic</keyword><keyword>boussinesq</keyword><keyword>equations</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>sea-level slope</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1026298519493</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., and D.

Both fields will benefit. To this end, we present an ocean state estimation (data assimilation) framework which is designed to obtain a dynamically consistent picture of the changing ocean circulation by combining global ocean data sets of arbitrary type with a general circulation model (GCM). The impact of geoid measurements on such estimates of the ocean circulation are numerous. For the mean circulation, a precise geoid describes the reference frame for dynamical signals in altimetric sea surface height observations. For the time-varying ocean signal, changing geoid information might be a valuable new information about correcting the changing flow field on time scales from a few month to a year, but the quantitative utility of such information has not yet been demonstrated. For a consistent estimate, some knowledge of the prior error covariances of all data fields is required. The final result must be consistent with prior error estimates for the data. State estimation is thus one of the few quantitative consistency checks for new geoid measurements anticipated from forthcoming space missions. Practical quantitative methods will yield a best possible estimate of the dynamical sea surface which, when combined with satellite altimetric surfaces, will produce a best-estimate marine geoid. The anticipated accuracy and precision of such estimates raises some novel modeling error issues which have not conventionally been of concern (the Boussinesq approximation, self-attraction and loading). Model skill at very high frequencies is a major concern because of the need to de-alias the data obtained by the inevitable oceanic temporal undersampling dictated by realistic satellite orbit configurations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Magazine Article">8</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acoustic thermometry in the North Pacific</title><secondary-title>CLIVAR Exchanges</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CLIVAR Exchanges</full-title></periodical><pages>15-22</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><notes>Dushaw, B.

Both fields will benefit. To this end, we present an ocean state estimation (data assimilation) framework which is designed to obtain a dynamically consistent picture of the changing ocean circulation by combining global ocean data sets of arbitrary type with a general circulation model (GCM), The impact of geoid measurements on such estimates of the ocean circulation are numerous. For the mean circulation, a precise geoid describes the reference frame for dynamical signals in altimetric sea surface height observations. For the time-varying ocean signal, changing geoid information might be a valuable new information about correcting the changing flow field on time scales from a few month to a year, but the quantitative utility of such information has not yet been demonstrated. For a consistent estimate, some knowledge of the prior error covariances of all data fields is required. The final result must be consistent with prior error estimates for the data. State estimation is thus one of the few quantitative consistency checks for new geoid measurements anticipated from forthcoming space missions. Practical quantitative methods will yield a best possible estimate of the dynamical sea surface which, when combined with satellite altimetric surfaces, will produce a best-estimate marine geoid. The anticipated accuracy and precision of such estimates raises some novel modeling error issues which have not conventionally been of concern (the Boussinesq approximation, selfattraction and loading). Model skill at very high frequencies is a major concern because of the need to de-alias the data obtained by the inevitable oceanic temporal undcrsampling dictated by realistic satellite orbit configurations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Howe, B.M.</author><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Mercer, J.A.</author><author>Worcester, P.F.</author><author>Colosi, J.A.</author><author>Cornuelle, B.C.</author><author>Dzieciuch, M.A.</author><author>Spindel, R.C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acoustic thermometry time series in the North Pacific</title><secondary-title>2003 International Conference Physics and Control.

Its main mission was to maintain the high accuracy altimeter measurements, provided since 1992 by TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P), ensuring continuity in observing and monitoring the ocean for intraseasonal to interannual changes, mean sea level, tides, and so forth. Despite four times less mass and power, the Jason-1 system has been designed to have the same performances as T/P, measuring sea surface topography at the centimeter level. This new Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales/National Aeronautics and Space Administration (CNES/NASA) mission also provides near real-time data for sea state and ocean forecast. The first 10 months of the Jason mission were dedicated to the verification of the system performance and cross-calibration with T/P measurements. A complete CALVAL plan was conducted by the Science and Project Teams of the mission based on in situ and regional experiments, global statistical approaches, and multisatellite comparisons, taking advantage of the T/P-Jason overlap during the first months of the mission. CALVAL and first science results showed that the Jason-1 performances were compliant with prelaunch specifications. This was a needed preamble before starting the routine phase of the mission in July 2003 with generation and distribution of validated geophysical data records to the whole user community.

We have determined that the observed increases in J(2) are caused primarily by a recent surge in subpolar glacial melting and by mass shifts in the Southern, Pacific, and Indian oceans. When these effects are removed, the residual trend in J(2) (-2.9 x 10(-11) year(-1)) becomes consistent with previous estimates of PGR from satellite and eclipse data.

The method solves the larger estimation problem by partitioning it into a series of smaller calculations. Errors with small correlation distances are derived by regional approximations, and errors associated with independent processes are evaluated separately from one another. The overall uncertainty of the model state, as well as the Kalman filter and smoother, is approximated by the sum of the corresponding individual components. The resulting smaller dimensionality of each separate element renders application of Kalman filtering and smoothing to the larger problem much more practical than otherwise. In particular, the approximation makes high-resolution global eddy-resolving data assimilation computationally viable. The approach is described and its efficacy demonstrated using a simple one-dimensional shallow water model.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heimbach, P</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Giering, R</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Sloot, P</author><author>Tan, C J K</author><author>Dongarra, J J</author><author>Hoekstra, A G</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Automatic generation of efficient adjoint code for a parallel Navier-Stokes solver</title><secondary-title>Computational Science-Iccs 2002, Pt Ii, Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computational Science-Iccs 2002, Pt Ii, Proceedings</full-title></periodical><pages>1019-1028</pages><volume>2330</volume><keywords><keyword>construction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><pub-location>Berlin</pub-location><publisher>Springer-Verlag Berlin</publisher><isbn>0302-9743

The task of minimizing a cost function measuring the ocean simulation vs. observation misfit is achieved through efficient calculation of the cost gradient w.r.t. a set of controls via the adjoint technique. The adjoint code of the parallel MIT general circulation model is generated using TAMC. To achieve a tractable problem in both CPU and memory requirements, despite the control flow, reversal, the adjoint code relies heavily on the balancing of storing vs. recomputation via the checkpointing method. Further savings are achieved by exploiting self-adjointedness of part of the computation. To retain scalability of the domain decomposition, handwritten adjoint routines are provided which complement routines of the parallel support package (such as inter-processor communications, global operations, active variable I/O) to perform corresponding operations in reverse mode. The size of the problem is illustrated for the global ocean estimation problem and results are given by way of example.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What is the thermohaline circulation?</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1179-+</pages><volume>298</volume><issue>5596</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1079329</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2002: What is the thermohaline circulation?

At the cost of increased computational load, the estimation (assimilation) method is chosen specifically so that the resulting state estimate is consistent with the model equations, having no artificial sources or sinks. To bring the model into close agreement with observations, its initial temperature and salinity conditions are permitted to change, as are the time-dependent surface fluxes of momentum, heat and freshwater. Resulting changes of these &quot;control vectors'' are largely consistent with accepted uncertainties in the hydrographic climatology and meteorological analyses. The assimilation procedure is able to correct for many of the traditional shortcomings of the flow field by changing the surface boundary conditions. Changes in the resulting flow field are predominantly on the gyre scale and affect many features that are often poorly simulated in traditional numerical simulations, such as the strengths of the Gulf Stream and its extension, the Azores Current and the anticyclonic circulation associated with the Labrador Sea. Tests of the results and their consistency with prior error assumptions show that the constrained model has moved considerably closer to the observations imposed as constraints, but has also moved closer to independent data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment not used in the assimilation procedure. In some regions where the comparisons remain indeterminate, not enough ocean observations are available, and it is difficult to ascribe the residuals to either the model or the observations. Although problems remain, a useful first solution to the global time-dependent ocean state estimation problem has been found. The estimates will continue to improve through the evolution of numerical models, computer power increases, more data, and more efficient estimation methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, Carl</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Pearce, R P</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean observations and the climate forecast problem</title><secondary-title>International Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>233-245</pages><volume>Volume 83</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><publisher>Academic Press</publisher><isbn>0074-6142</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0074-6142(02)80170-X</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2002: Ocean observations and the climate forecast problem.

Uncritical use of the steady/laminar framework has led to a gross distortion of the science, particularly the study of climate change, partly manifested by the belief that a comparatively small number of simple observations suffices to describe the system, and by the inference that oceanic behavior under changed external forcing can be deduced by pure thought without integration of the equations of motion. All of the evidence of the last 25 years shows that the behavior is much more interesting and complex than this distorted view would imply. Real progress will involve confronting the actual system, not the fictitious one.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oceanic age and transient tracers: Analytical and numerical solutions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><volume>107</volume><issue>C6</issue><keywords><keyword>advection/diffusion</keyword><keyword>age tracers</keyword><keyword>chlorofluorocarbon</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>diffusion</keyword><keyword>eastern north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>gyre ventilation</keyword><keyword>mixing</keyword><keyword>observations</keyword><keyword>pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>pycnocline</keyword><keyword>salinity</keyword><keyword>stratospheric transport</keyword><keyword>tracers</keyword><keyword>transient</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2001jc000797</electronic-resource-num><notes>Wunsch, C., 2002: Oceanic age and transient tracers: Analytical and numerical solutions.

This richness tends to make interpretation of observations, which are inevitably thin in both space and time, difficult, in contrast to the situation in modeling studies. At least six different timescales and corresponding space scales can appear in one-dimensional problems. In higher dimensions the number of scales increases. Several examples of analytical and numerical solutions are explored for the light they cast on understanding a fluid flow. Boundary Green functions emerge as the fundamental physical/mathematical link between interior tracer distributions and surface and other boundary variations. With transient tracers in inverse calculations one should normally use the underlying tracer distributions to attempt to solve for fundamental fluid properties, such as the mixing coefficients, rather than ambiguous &quot;ventilation'' times, which among other problems, may be determined only by the detection threshold and are often mainly functions of the tracer decay constant rather than of fluid properties. Tracers that are transient only through stochastic boundary conditions show that large-scale space/time patterns can emerge in the tracer field, having little or no clear connection to the underlying fluid flow.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Xing, Z F</author><author>Fu, L L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of the Indonesian Throughflow on the Pacific and Indian oceans</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>1404-1429</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>appearance reality</keyword><keyword>climatology</keyword><keyword>el-nino</keyword><keyword>exchange</keyword><keyword>general-circulation model</keyword><keyword>north pacific</keyword><keyword>originate</keyword><keyword>parameterization</keyword><keyword>thermocline</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(2002)032&lt;1404:Eotito&gt;2.0.Co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., I.

The ITF contributes to the maintenance of the model circulation system around eastern Australia and the southern Indian Ocean. Blockage of the ITF weakens the Indian Ocean South Equatorial Current and Agulhas Current and strengthens the East Australian Current. The ITF does not affect the Mindanao Current, but drains waters carried by this current into the Indian Ocean and thus reduces tropical-subtropical exchange in the North Pacific. Meanwhile, it helps maintain a stronger New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent and thus enhances tropical-subtropical exchange in the south. Water parcels traveling along the western boundary of the South Pacific cross the equator in the presence of the ITF but are confined to the Southern Hemisphere without the ITF. The southern &quot;exchange window'' in which subducted waters can reach the Tropics is wider with than without the ITF. Some parcels from the southern subtropics can reach the Tropics with open ITF, but recirculate back to the subtropical gyre when the ITF is closed. These &quot;excess'' recirculated parcels reach several degrees farther south and outcrop north of Tasmania. The consequence on sea surface temperature (SST) there may have an important implication to the local climate. Blockage of the ITF depresses the mean thermocline of the tropical Pacific, increases SST in the central to eastern equatorial Pacific, and thus reduces the SST difference between the warm pool and cold tongue. It also raises the mean thermocline of the Indian Ocean (especially the southern Indian Ocean) and decreases SST in the southern Indian Ocean. Blockage of the ITF reduces seasonal-to-interannual thermocline fluctuations in the central to eastern equatorial Pacific because the resulting deeper thermocline attenuates fluctuations in response to local Ekman pumping. The opposite is true in the southern Indian Ocean for the interannual timescale. However, seasonal thermocline fluctuation in that area is weakened when the ITF is blocked (despite a shallower thermocline). It indicates that local Ekman pumping is not the dominant mechanism controlling seasonal thermocline variability there as previously suggested. Radiation of planetary waves from the ITF area and advection by the ITF-dependent South Equatorial Current could also be important. Blockage of the ITF also reduces interannual variability of SST in the eastern equatorial Pacific and enhances those in the tropical southern Indian Ocean and south of Tasmania. The results indicate that the ITF may affect El Nino-Southern Oscillation by modifying tropical-subtropical exchanges, mean tropical thermocline structure, mean SST difference between the warm pool and cold tongue, and seasonal-to-interannual variabilities of thermocline depth and SST.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fieguth, Paul W</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping and pseudo-inverse algorithms for data assimilation</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium</full-title></periodical><pages>3221-3223</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><publisher>IEEE</publisher><isbn>0-7803-7536-X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1027136</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fieguth, P.

In such reduced-state filters, the measurement update takes place on a coarser grid than that of the general circulation model (GCM); therefore, these filters require mapping operators from the GCM grid to the reduced state and vice-versa. The general requirements are that the state-reduction and interpolation operators be pseudo-inverses of each other, that the coarse state defines a closed dynamical system, that the mapping operations be insensitive to noise, and that they be appropriate for regions with irregular coastlines and bathymetry. In this paper we investigate a variety of approaches, including computing the pseudoinverse by brute force, using the FFT, subsampling methods, implicit methods, and finally develop a novel iterative approach. We also evaluate the mapping performance of eleven interpolation kernels; surprisingly, common kernels such as bilinear, exponential, Gaussian, and sinc, performed only moderately well. This comprehensive study greatly reduces the computational bottleneck and guesswork of pseudo-inverse algorithms, making possible the application of reduced-state filters to global problems at state-of-the-art resolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Upper-ocean Heat Budget Inferred From ECCO-2 Ocean Data Assimilation</title><secondary-title>2002 International Symposium En Route to GODAE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2002 International Symposium En Route to GODAE</full-title></periodical><pages>2</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><pub-location>Biarritz, France</pub-location><notes>Lee, T., Fukumori, I., Menemenlis, D., &amp;amp; Fu, L.-L.

Compared with other countries, sea level rise could cause a relative significant impact on Taiwan. In addition, resulting from the over-withdrawal of groundwater, the western area of Taiwan suffers from a severe subsidence. Therefore, monitoring sea level variations and vertical motions have become a very important issue for Taiwan. Traditionally, the most common instruments used to measure sea surface heights tide gauges and satellite altimetry; however, the tide gauge records contain the crustal vertical motions and the data span of satellite altimetry data is too short to avoid low-frequency effects on the trend determination. Since tide gauge records contain sea level and vertical motion signals and altimetry data contains sea level information only, vertical motions at gauges can be accurately computed by the differences of tide gauges and satellite altimetry. The estimated vertical motions show that most gauge stations in Taiwan and Philippines were subsiding except for in China. The vertical uplift in China is related to the geological tectonics and geomorphology. In order to determine sea level accurately around Taiwan, we adopted a novel algorithm to determine accurate sea level trend by combining tide gauges and satellite altimeter data in the study. First of all, Hilbert-Huang Transformation (HHT) method is used to decompose the selected tide gauge records completely into few independent monotones cycles, which called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Afterwards, the residual time series computed by subtracting sea level time series reconstructed using specific IMFs, which represent low frequencies and cannot be clearly detected in altimeter data, from the corresponding altimetry data is fitted to derive the sea level trend. According to the result, the estimated sea level trend around Taiwan is 4.23 mm/yr, which is higher than global mean sea level of 3.11 mm/yr [Ablain et al., 2009]. A comparison of steric sea level (SSL), GRACE derived ocean mass change and total sea level around Taiwan is also investigated in the study. The result indicates that SSL contributes more than ocean mass does and dominates sea level trends around Taiwan. Finally, the global sea level trend derived from the reconstructed latitude-weighted time series using the last two IMFs by HHT is determined at 3.12 mm/yr, agreeing well with previous studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halpern, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2001 Annual Report- Climate Variability Program</title></titles><periodical/><pages>78</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><pub-location>Pasadena, CA</pub-location><isbn>2002004854</isbn><notes>Halpern, D.

Year-to-year changes in the CO 2 growth rate that exceed variations in the fossil fuel source indicate a significant variability in these global CO 2 sinks. However, the enormous complexity of the terrestrial and oceanic biogeochemical systems that absorb atmospheric CO 2 makes these sinks extremely difficult to understand and precisely quantify. Many techniques, including the interpretation of the relative changes in atmospheric CO 2 and O 2 /N 2 , ocean modeling, and atmospheric data inversions, have been employed to estimate the mean and variability of global CO 2 sinks. However, uncertainty remains large. The goal of this thesis is to improve understanding of global CO 2 sinks by considering (1) the error in the atmospheric O 2 /N 2 partitioning method due to the neglect of interannual variability in the air-sea fluxes of O 2 , and (2) the interannual variability of the ocean CO 2 sink. A global, high-resolution ocean general circulation model is used to estimate the magnitude and understand the mechanisms of interannual variability in air-sea fluxes of both CO 2 and O 2 . I find that the global variability in the fluxes of both gases are dominantly forced by large-scale physical processes governing upper ocean dynamics, particularly El Niño / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, for O 2 , the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Estimates of the extremes of CO 2 and O 2 flux variability for the period 1980-1998 are ±0.5x10 15 grams Carbon/yr (PgC/yr) and -70/+100x10 12 mol/yr (Tmol/yr), respectively. Global O 2 flux variability implies up to a 1.0 PgC/yr error in estimates of interannual variability in land and ocean CO 2 sinks derived from atmospheric O 2 /N 2 observations. This error is significant for estimates of annual sinks, but it is cumulatively negligible for estimates of mean sinks from October 1991 to April 1998. Increasing convergence of estimates of land and ocean carbon sink variability from independent methods is also found.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dutkiewicz, Stephanie</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Marshall, J</author><author>Gregg, W W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual variability of phytoplankton abundances in the North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Deep-Sea Research Part Ii-Topical Studies in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Deep-Sea Research Part Ii-Topical Studies in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>2323-2344</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>formulation</keyword><keyword>general-circulation-model</keyword><keyword>nitrogen</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>organic-carbon</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>sargasso sea</keyword><keyword>simulation</keyword><keyword>spring bloom</keyword><keyword>time-series</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/s0967-0645(00)00178-8</electronic-resource-num><notes>Dutkiewicz, S., M.

A simplified, two-layer bio-physical model reveals regional responses to interannual variability of convective mixing. Vertical mixing can promote productivity in the surface waters through enhanced nutrient supply, but also can retard productivity due to the transport of phytoplankton below Sverdrup's critical depth. The balance of these processes determines the regimes of response in the two-layer model. The regimes may be identified by the ratio of the thickness of Sverdrup's critical layer during spring and the end of winter mixed layer, h(c)/h(m). The responses predicted by the simplified model are found in a more sophisticated four-compartment, nitrogen-based ecosystem model, driven by a general circulation model of the North Atlantic. Anomalously strong convective mixing leads to enhanced chlorophyll concentrations in regions of shallow mixed layers (h(c)/h(m) similar to 1), such as the subtropics. In contrast, in the subpolar regions, where mixed layers are deeper (h(c)/h(m) much less than 1), the sensitivity to convective mixing is weaker, and increased mixing can lead to lower phytoplankton abundances. The numerical model also reveals regions of more complex behavior, such as the inter-gyre boundary, where advective supply of nutrients plays a significant role on interannual timescales. Preliminary analyses of in situ and remote observations from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series, Ocean Weather Station &quot;India&quot; and the Coastal Zone Color Scanner also show qualitative agreement. The conceptual framework provides a tool for the analysis of ongoing remote ocean-color observations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Constrained and unconstrained OAM values are discussed in the contest of closing the planet's angular momentum budget. The estimation procedure yields noticeable improvements in the agreement with the observed Earth rotation parameters, particularly at the seasonal timescale.

The basic circulation is a robust feature in a hierarchy of model setups. It exists in the purely barotropic case driven by steady winds and is even maintained when realistic daily forcing is added, The narrow recirculation zone is manifested by a sea level depression spanning from the Denmark Strait across the Irminger into the Labrador Sea.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirose, N</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Zlotnicki, V</author><author>Ponte, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling the high-frequency barotropic response of the ocean to atmospheric disturbances: Sensitivity to forcing, topography, and friction</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>30987-30995</pages><volume>106</volume><issue>C12</issue><keywords><keyword>global ocean</keyword><keyword>pressure</keyword><keyword>satellite altimetry</keyword><keyword>sea-level variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2000jc000763</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hirose, N., I.

This heating is parameterized as a spatially uniform heat flux of 50 mW m(-2) through the (flat) ocean floor, in contrast with previous studies that have considered regional circulation changes caused by an isolated hot spot or a series of plumes along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In our model results the equilibrated response is largely advective: a deep perturbation of the meridional overturning cell on the order of several sverdrups is produced, connecting with an upper level circulation at high latitudes, allowing the additional heat to be released to the atmosphere. Rising motion in the perturbation deep cell is concentrated near the equator. The upward penetration of this cell is limited by the thermocline, analogous to the role of the stratosphere in limiting the upward penetration of convective plumes in the atmosphere. The magnitude of the advective response is inversely proportional to the deep stratification; with a weaker background meridional overturning circulation and a less stratified abyss the overturning maximum of the perturbation deep cell is increased. This advective response also cools the low-latitude thermocline. The qualitative behavior is similar in both a single-hemisphere and a double-hemisphere configuration. In summary, the anomalous circulation driven by geothermal fluxes is more substantial than previously thought. We are able to understand the structure and strength of the response in the idealized geometry and further extend these ideas to explain the results of Adcroft et al. [2001], where the impact of geothermal heating was examined using a global configuration.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Fu, Lee-Lueng</author><author>Cazenave, Anny</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Data Assimilation by Models</title><secondary-title>International Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>237-xvii</pages><volume>Volume 69</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><publisher>Academic Press</publisher><isbn>0074-6142</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0074-6142(01)80150-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., 2001: Data Assimilation by Models.

This chapter provides an overview of data assimilation with an emphasis on applications to analyzing satellite altimeter data. The problem of data assimilation belongs to the wider field of estimation and control theories. The estimates of the dynamic system are improved by correcting model errors with the observations on the one hand and synthesizing observations by the models on the other. Much of the original mathematical theory of data assimilation was developed in the context of ballistics applications. Data assimilation is an emerging area in oceanography, stimulated by recent improvements in computational and modeling capabilities and the increase in the amount of available oceanographic observations. The continuing increase in computational capabilities have made numerical ocean modeling a commonplace. One of the central merits of data assimilation is its extraction of oceanographic signals from incomplete and noisy observations. Most oceanographic measurements—including altimetry—are characterized by their sparseness in space and time compared to the inherent scales of ocean variability; this translates into noisy and gappy measurements.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adcroft, Alistair J.</author><author>Scott, J R</author><author>Marotzke, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of geothermal heating on the global ocean circulation</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>1735-1738</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>abyssal</keyword><keyword>energetics</keyword><keyword>flow</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>wind</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2000gl012182</electronic-resource-num><notes>Adcroft, A., J.

Increasing emphasis has to be put, therefore, on observing the rapidly changing ocean state on time scales ranging from weeks to decades and beyond, and on understanding the ocean's response to changing atmospheric forcing conditions. As outlined in various strategy and implementation documents (e.g., the implementation plans of WOCE, AMS, CLIVAR, and GODAE) a combination of the global ocean data sets with a state-of-the-art numerical circulation model is required to interpret the various diverse data sets and to produce the best possible estimates of the time-varying ocean circulation. The mechanism of ocean state estimates is a powerful tool for such a &quot;synthesis&quot; of observations, obtained on very complex space-time pattern, into one dynamically consistent picture of the global time-evolving ocean circulation. This process has much in common with ongoing analysis and reanalysis activities in the atmospheric community. But because the ocean is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, substantially under-sampled, the burden put on the modeling and estimations components is substantially larger than in the atmosphere. Moreover, the smaller dynamical eddy scales which need to be properly parameterized or resolved in ocean model simulations, put stringent requirements on computational resources for ongoing and participated climate research.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirose, N</author><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Ponte, R M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A non-isostatic global sea level response to barometric pressure near 5 days</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>2441-2444</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>normal-modes</keyword><keyword>pacific</keyword><keyword>tides</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>waves</keyword><keyword>world ocean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2001gl012907</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hirose, N., I.

Nonisostatic signals are, however, observed at many tropical tide gauges at periods near 5 days. Our analysis of satellite observations reveals the global nature of these signals, involving nonisostatic sea level fluctuations with nearly uniform phase within separate basins and an out-of-phase oscillation between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Comparisons with a barotropic model further link the observed signals to forcing by a large scale pressure wave in the atmosphere and show that constrictions between basins prevent an isostatic response from being established. The apparent forced, nonresonant nature of the nonisostatic response contrasts with the predominantly resonant ocean dynamics at higher frequencies and may be relevant to explain the behavior of the long period tides.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Bold, G</author><author>Chui, C.-S.</author><author>Colosi, J</author><author>Cornuelle, B</author><author>Desaubies, Y</author><author>Dzieciuch, M</author><author>Forbes, A</author><author>Gaillard, F</author><author>Gould, J</author><author>Howe, B</author><author>Lawrence, M</author><author>Lynch, J</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mercer, J</author><author>Mikhaelvsky, P</author><author>Munk, W</author><author>Nakano, I</author><author>Schott, F</author><author>Send, U</author><author>Spindel, R</author><author>Terre, T</author><author>Worcester, P</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Koblinsky, C J</author><author>Smith, N R</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Observing the ocean in the 2000's: A strategy for the role of acoustic tomography in ocean climate observation</title><secondary-title>Observing the Oceans in the 21st Century</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Observing the Oceans in the 21st Century</full-title></periodical><pages>391-418</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><pub-location>Melbourne, Australia</pub-location><publisher>GODAE Project Office and Bureau of Meteorology</publisher><notes>Dushaw, B.

This covariance matching approach is both a powerful diagnostic tool for addressing theoretical questions and an efficient estimator for real data assimilation studies. Provided that model and data errors are independent, that error propagation is approximately linear, and that an observability condition is met, it is in theory possible to fully resolve covariance matrices for both model and data errors. In practice, however, due to large uncertainties in sample estimates of covariance matrices, the number of statistically significant parameters that can be estimated is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the total number of independent observations. The covariance matching approach is applied in the North Pacific (5°–60°N, 132°–252°E) to TOPEX/Poseidon sea level anomaly data, acoustic tomography data from the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate Project, and a GCM. A reduced state linear model that describes large-scale internal (baroclinic) error dynamics is constructed. Twin experiments suggest that altimetric data are ill suited to estimating the statistics of the vertical GCM error structure, but that such estimates can in theory be obtained using acoustic data. The particular GCM integration exhibits a warming trend relative to TOPEX/Poseidon data of order 1 cm yr−1 corresponding to a peak warming of up to 0.2°C yr−1 in the acoustic data at depths ranging from 50 to 200 m. At the annual cycle, GCM and TOPEX/Poseidon sea level anomaly are in phase, but GCM amplitude is 2 cm smaller, with the error confined above 200-m depth. After removal of trends and annual cycles, the low-frequency/wavenumber (periods &gt;2 months, wavelengths &gt;16°) TOPEX/Poseidon sea level anomaly is order 6 cm2. The GCM explains about 40% of that variance. By covariance matching, it is estimated that 60% of the GCM–TOPEX/Poseidon residual variance is consistent with the reduced state linear model.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Boulanger, J P</author><author>Foo, A</author><author>Fu, L L</author><author>Giering, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Data assimilation by an intermediate coupled ocean-atmosphere model: Application to the 1997-1998 El Nino</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>26063-26087</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>drag coefficient</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>initialization</keyword><keyword>prediction</keyword><keyword>sea-level</keyword><keyword>system</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>thermodynamics</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific</keyword><keyword>wind stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2000jc900118</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., J.

Model data consistency is examined. Impact of the assimilation on forecast is evaluated. The ocean component of the coupled model consists of a shallow water model with two baroclinic modes, an Ekman shear layer, and a mixed layer temperature equation. The atmospheric model is a statistical one (based on dominant covariance of historical surface temperature and pseudo wind stress anomaly data). The adjoint method is used to fit the coupled model to 6 months of data by optimally adjusting the initial state and model parameters. A forecast is performed using the end state of an assimilation experiment as initial conditions and using parameters estimated during the assimilation period. Thus the model state during the assimilation and that during the forecast belong to the same model trajectory in different periods. Such an initialization procedure is useful in avoiding initial shock during forecast due to inconsistency of an initial state with the coupled model physics. As a result of optimal adjustments of initial state and parameters, the model is able to reproduce observed interannual variability of sea surface temperature and sea level reasonably well. The averaged residual model data misfits over various 6 month periods are 0.5 degreesC and 5 cm, respectively. The model has a limited skill in reproducing much of the off-equatorial wind anomalies. The residual model data misfit in pseudo wind stress anomaly is larger than 10 m(2) s(-2). Forecasts initialized from the assimilation product are overall more realistic than those simply initialized from wind-forced ocean states. Consistent improvement due to optimal initialization is found for sea surface temperature and sea level anomalies in the central-eastern Pacific and zonal pseudo wind stress anomaly in the central Pacific, both in terms of root-mean-squared deviation from and correlation with the data. The adjustments of parameters in addition to initial state in a coupled context is found to be important to improving the model data consistency during the assimilation and the forecast. In particular, the estimated drag and damping coefficients properly regulate the relative strength of forcing and damping of the ocean state so as to fit the three types of observations during the assimilation (initialization) period, which facilitates the development of a large-amplitude warming event during the forecast. The study demonstrates the utility of oceanic and atmospheric data to estimate initial state and model parameters in a coupled context, which is useful to the evaluation, improvement, and initialization of El Nino-Southern Oscillation forecast models.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McKinley, Galen A.</author><author>Follows, Michael J.</author><author>Marshall, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interannual variability of the air-sea flux of oxygen in the North Atlantic</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>2933-2936</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>cycle</keyword><keyword>energy</keyword><keyword>models</keyword><keyword>ocean</keyword><keyword>ratio</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2000gl011492</electronic-resource-num><notes>McKinley, G.

We begin to address the validity of this assumption by investigating the magnitude and mechanisms of interannual variability in the flux of oxygen across the sea surface using a North Atlantic biogeochemical model. The model, based on the MIT ocean general circulation model, captures the gross patterns and seasonal cycle of nutrients and oxygen within the basin. The air-sea oxygen flux exhibits significant interannual variability in the North Atlantic, with a standard deviation (0.36 mol m(-2) y(-1)) that is a large fraction of the mean (0.85 mol m(-2) y(-1)). This is primarily a consequence of variability in winter convection in the subpolar gyre.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stammer, D</author><author>Chassignet, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocean State Estimation and Prediction in Support of Oceanographic Research</title><secondary-title>Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>51-56</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2000</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5670/oceanog.2000.34</electronic-resource-num><notes>Stammer, D., and E.

Giering's software tool Tangent-Linear and Adjoint Model Compiler (TAMC). The TAMC's recipe for (FORTRAN-) line-by-line generation of adjoint code is explained by interpreting an adjoint model strictly as the operator that gives the sensitivity of the output of a model to its input. Then, the sensitivity of 1993 annual mean heat transport across 29 degrees N in the Atlantic, to the hydrography on January 1, 1993, is calculated from a global solution of the GCM. The &quot;kinematic sensitivity&quot; to initial temperature variations is isolated, showing how the latter would influence heat transport if they did not affect the density and hence the flow. Over 1 year the heat transport at 29 degrees N is influenced kinematically from regions up to 20 degrees upstream in the western boundary current and up to 5 degrees upstream in the interior. In contrast, the dynamical influences of initial temperature (and salinity) perturbations spread from as far as the rim of the Labrador Sea to the 29 degrees N section along the western boundary. The sensitivities calculated with the adjoint compare excellently to those from a perturbation calculation with the dynamical model. Perturbations in initial interior salinity influence meridional overturning and heat transport when they have propagated to the western boundary and can thus influence the integrated east-west density difference. Our results support the notion that boundary monitoring of meridional mass and heat transports is feasible.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Colosi, J A</author><author>Baggeroer, Arthur B</author><author>Birdsall, Theodore G</author><author>Clark, C</author><author>Cornuelle, Bruce D</author><author>Costa, D</author><author>Dushaw, Brian D.</author><author>Dzieciuch, Matthew A</author><author>Forbes, Andrew M G</author><author>Howe, Bruce M</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Mercer, James A</author><author>Metzger, K</author><author>Munk, Walter H</author><author>Spindel, Robert C</author><author>Worcester, Peter F</author><author>Wunsch, Carl I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A review of recent results on ocean acoustic wave propagation in random media: basin scales</title><secondary-title>IEEE J.

We describe data obtained using bottom-mounted receivers, including U.S. Navy Sound Surveilance System arrays, at ranges up to 5 Mm from the Pioneer Seamount source. Stable identifiable ray arrivals are observed in several cases, but some receiving arrays are not well suited to detecting the direct ray arrivals. At 5-Mm range, travel-time variations at tidal frequencies (about 50 ms peak to peak) agree well with predicted values, providing verification of the acoustic measurements as well as the tidal model. On the longest and northernmost acoustic paths, the time series of resolved ray travel times show an annual cycle peak-to-peak variation of about 1 s and other fluctuations caused by natural oceanic variability. An annual cycle is not evident in travel times from shorter acoustic paths in the eastern Pacific, though only one realization of the annual cycle is available. The low-pass-filtered travel times are estimated to an accuracy of about 10 ms. This travel-time uncertainty corresponds to errors in range- and depth-averaged temperature of only a few millidegrees, while the annual peak-to-peak variation in temperature averaged horizontally over the acoustic path and vertically over the upper 1 km of ocean is up to 0.5°C.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirose, Naoki</author><author>Fukumori, Ichiro</author><author>Yoon, Jong-Hwan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assimilation of TOPEX/POSEIDON Altimeter Data with a Reduced Gravity Model of the Japan Sea</title><secondary-title>Journal of Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>53-64</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Data assimilation</keyword><keyword>Japan Sea</keyword><keyword>Kalman filter</keyword><keyword>TOPEX/POSEIDON</keyword><keyword>reduced-gravity model</keyword><keyword>sea level</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><publisher>Kluwer Academic Publishers</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1007707405711</electronic-resource-num><notes>Hirose, N., I.

Open boundary conditions are implemented to the west of the Indonesian Archipelago and near 30S. The approach simultaneously optimizes the initial conditions of the hydrographic fields, surface fluxes, and the open boundary conditions (temperature, salinity, and horizontal velocities). Compared to previous results obtained in a closed domain, the estimated velocity field shows a marked improvement near the southern boundary, with a reasonably strong Agulhas Current leaving the model domain. The Indonesian throughflow (ITF) is estimated as 2.7 Sv (1 Sv is 10(6) m(3)/s) westward, which is on the low end of the range of previous estimates. The model is able to sharpen fronts in surface salinity, compared to climatology, and suggests that the low surface salinity values in the eastern equatorial region arise from advection out of the Bay of Bengal rather than from the ITF. Consistent with the closed-domain results, the meridional overturning is dominated by a shallow (above 500 m), wind-driven cell of 16 Sv maximum, which carries the bulk of the southward heat transport. We have defined generalizations of meridional heat and freshwater transports appropriate in the presence of a throughflow. The estimated meridional heat transport has a maximum of 0.8 PW at 12S, maximum freshwater transport is 0.29 Sv southward at 9S. The meridional transport divergences are well balanced by the surface heat and freshwater fluxes, indicating near-steady state and small influence of the ITF.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fukumori, I</author><author>Raghunath, R</author><author>Fu, L L</author><author>Chao, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assimilation of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data into a global ocean circulation model: How good are the results?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>25647-25665</pages><volume>104</volume><issue>C11</issue><keywords><keyword>gulf-stream model</keyword><keyword>height</keyword><keyword>kalman filter</keyword><keyword>sea-surface</keyword><keyword>tropical pacific-ocean</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>wind-stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/1999jc900193</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fukumori, I., R.

A global primitive equation model of the ocean is forced by daily winds and climatological heat fluxes corresponding to the period from January 1992 to January 1994. The physical nature of sea level's temporal variability from periods of days to a year is examined on the basis of spectral analyses of model results and comparisons with satellite altimetry and tide gauge measurements. The study elucidates and diagnoses the inhomogeneous physics of sea level change in space and frequency domain. At midlatitudes, large-scale sea level variability is primarily due to steric changes associated with the seasonal heating and cooling cycle of the surface layer. In comparison, changes in the tropics and high latitudes are mainly wind driven. Wind-driven variability exhibits a strong latitudinal dependence in itself. Wind-driven changes are largely baroclinic in the tropics but barotropic at higher latitudes. Baroclinic changes are dominated by the annual harmonic of the first baroclinic mode and is largest off the equator; variabilities associated with equatorial waves are smaller in comparison. Wind-driven barotropic changes exhibit a notable enhancement over several abyssal plains in the Southern Ocean, which is likely due to resonant planetary wave modes in basins semienclosed by discontinuities in potential vorticity. Otherwise, barotropic sea level changes are typically dominated by high frequencies with as much as half the total variance in periods shorter than 20 days, reflecting the frequency spectra of wind stress curl. Implications of the findings with regards to analyzing observations and data assimilation are discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baggeroer, A.

Interpreting climate change signals from fluctuations in sea level is therefore complicated. The annual cycle of heat flux is 150 ± 25 watts per square meter (peak-to-peak, corresponding to a 0.2°C vertically averaged temperature cycle); an interannual change of similar magnitude is also detected. Meteorological estimates of surface heat flux, if accurate, require a large seasonal cycle in the advective heat flux.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fieguth, P</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Ho, T</author><author>Willsky, A</author><author>Wunsch, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping Mediterranean Altimeter Data with a Multiresolution Optimal Interpolation Algorithm</title><secondary-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>535-546</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0426(1998)015&lt;0535:MMADWA&gt;2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fieguth, P., D.

The principal advantages of the multiresolution scheme are its high computational efficiency, the requirement for explicit statistical models for the oceanographic signal and the measurement errors, and the production of error variances for all estimates at multiple scales. A set of Matlab-callable routines that implement the multiresolution scheme have been made available via anonymous FTP. The oceanographic signal is here modeled as a stationary 1/kμ process, where k is the horizontal wavenumber. Measurement noise is modeled as the sum of two separate random processes: a Gaussian white noise process and a correlated process of a low wavenumber representing the uncertainties in the orbital position of the satellite and in the atmospheric load corrections. The efficiency of the multiresolution scheme allowed the testing of more than 16000 sets of hypothesized statistical prior model parameters to determine the most likely parameters. Mapping results with and without low wavenumber error corrections are presented and compared.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, T</author><author>Marotzke, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal cycles of meridional overturning and heat transport of the Indian Ocean</title><secondary-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Physical Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>923-943</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>deep currents</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>fluxes</keyword><keyword>monsoon</keyword><keyword>somali current</keyword><keyword>south</keyword><keyword>throughflow</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/1520-0485(1998)028&lt;0923:scomoa&gt;2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., and J.

Interannual variability is minimized by penalizing the temporal drift from one seasonal cycle to another during a two-year integration. The resultant meridional overturning and heat transport display large seasonal variations, with maximum amplitudes of 18 and 22 (x 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) for the overturning and 1.8 and 1.4 (x 10(15) W) for heat transport near 10 degrees S and 10 degrees N, respectively. A dynamical decomposition of the overturning and heat transport shows that the rime-varying Ekman flow plus its barotropic compensation can explain a large parr of the seasonal variations in overturning and heat transport. The maximum variations at 10 degrees N and 10 degrees S are associated with monsoon reversal over the northern Indian Ocean and changes of the easterlies over the southern Indian Ocean. An external mode with variable topography has a moderate contribution where the Somali Current and the corresponding gyre reverse direction seasonally. Contribution from vertical shear (thermal wind and ageostrophic shear) is dominant near the southern boundary and large near the Somali Current latitudes. The dominant balance in the zonally integrated heat budget is between heat storage change and heat transport convergence except south of 15 degrees S. Optimization with seasonal forcings improves estimates of sea surface temperatures, but the annual average overturning and heat transport are very similar to previous results with annual mean forcings. The annual average heat transport consists of roughly equal contributions from time-mean and time-varying fields of meridional velocities and temperatures in the northern Indian Ocean, indicating a significant rectification to the hear transport due to the time-varying fields. The time-mean and time-varying contributions are primarily due to the overturning and horizontal gyre, respectively. Inclusion of TOPEX data enhances the seasonal cycles of the estimated overturning and heat transport in the central Indian Ocean significantly and improves the estimated equatorial zonal flows but leads to unrealistic estimates of the velocity structure near the Indonesian Throughflow region, most likely owing to the deficiencies in the lateral boundary conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Fieguth, Paul W</author><author>Wunsch, Carl I</author><author>Willsky, Alan S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adaptation of a fast optimal interpolation algorithm to the mapping of oceanographic data</title><secondary-title>J.

This algorithm produces solution and error estimates which are consistent with those obtained from exact least squares methods, but at a small fraction of the computational cost. Problems whose solution would be completely impractical using exact least squares, that is, problems with tens or hundreds of thousands of measurements and estimation grid points, can easily be solved on a small workstation using the multiscale algorithm. In contrast to methods previously proposed for solving large least squares problems, our approach provides estimation error statistics while permitting long-range correlations, using all measurements, and permitting arbitrary measurement locations. The multiscale algorithm itself, published elsewhere, is not the focus of this paper. However, the algorithm requires statistical models having a very particular multiscale structure; it is the development of a class of multiscale statistical models, appropriate for oceanographic mapping problems, with which we concern ourselves in this paper. The approach is illustrated by mapping temperature in the northeastern Pacific. The number of hydrographic stations is kept deliberately small to show that multiscale and exact least squares results are comparable. A portion of the data were not used in the analysis; these data serve to test the multiscale estimates. A major advantage of the present approach is the ability to repeat the estimation procedure a large number of times for sensitivity studies, parameter estimation, and model testing. We have made available by anonymous Ftp a set of MATLAB-callable routines which implement the multiscale algorithm and the statistical models developed in this paper.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Wunsch, Carl I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linearization of an oceanic general circulation model for data assimilation and climate studies</title><secondary-title>J.

The underlying assumption is that modern GCMs are, or will become, sufficiently accurate so that large-scale differences with the real ocean are small and have linear physics. Model Green?s functions are used to construct a reduced-order linear model that compares favorably with the large-scale response of the GCM away from the western boundary. In a numerical example, the linear model is applied to the estimation of the large-scale internal structure of a simulated ocean using pseudotomographic and altimetric measurements. The sensitivity of the solution to a priori statistical assumptions is analyzed. Several algorithmic improvements are explored to render the estimation procedure more efficient, more accurate, and easier to implement than in previous studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Webb, Tony</author><author>Wunsch, Carl I</author><author>Send, Uwe</author><author>Hill, Christopher N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Basin-scale ocean circulation from combined altimetric, tomographic and model data</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>618-621</pages><volume>385</volume><issue>6617</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1997</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/385618a0</electronic-resource-num><notes>Menemenlis, D., Webb, T., Wunsch, C.

Estimates of oceanic flow are currently made on the basis of space-borne measurements of the sea surface, and monitoring of the ocean interior. Satellite altimetry and acoustic tomography are complementary for this purpose(1), as the former provides detailed horizontal coverage of the surface, and the latter the requisite vertical sampling of the interior. High-quality acoustic-tomographic(2) and altimetric(3) data are now available to test the combined power of these technologies for estimating oceanic flows. Here we demonstrate that, with the aid of state-of-the-art numerical models, it is possible to recover from these data a detailed spatio-temporal record of flow over basin-scale volumes of fluid. Our present results are restricted to the Mediterranean Sea, but the method described here provides a powerful tool for studying oceanic circulation worldwide.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Tong</author><author>Marotzke, Jochem</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inferring meridional mass and heat transports of the Indian Ocean by fitting a general circulation model to climatological data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>10585-10602</pages><volume>102</volume><issue>C5</issue><keywords><keyword>data assimilation</keyword><keyword>dynamics</keyword><keyword>north-atlantic</keyword><keyword>steady-state</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/97JC00464</electronic-resource-num><notes>Lee, T., and J.

By estimating target temperatures and salinities near the artificially closed side boundaries as part of the optimization procedure, a steady solution that is consistent with climatological data within limits of observational errors is found. The resultant meridional overturning is vigorous (14 Sv; 1 Sv = 10(6) m(3)/s) only in the upper 1000 m. The estimated deep inflow entering the Indian Ocean from the south is weak. Requiring a large net northward inflow at depth does not result in strong inferior upwelling but leads to unrealistically large baroclinic mass exchange and implied vertical mixing near the Indonesian throughflow region. The shallow overturning is the main carrier of the southward heat transport, which has a maximum of 0.8 PW (1 PW = 10(15) W) near 15 degrees S. Wind forcing plays a key role in driving the estimated overturning of the Indian Ocean. This result is in disagreement with previous interpretations about the central role of surface heat flux in driving a vigorous deep overturning of the Indian Ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marshall, John</author><author>Adcroft, Alistair J.</author><author>Hill, Chris</author><author>Perelman, Lev</author><author>Heisey, Curt</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A finite-volume, incompressible Navier Stokes model for studies of the ocean on parallel computers</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>5753-5766</pages><volume>102</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>equations</keyword><keyword>sigma</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/96JC02775</electronic-resource-num><notes>Marshall, J., A.

A ''pressure correction'' method is used which is solved as a Poisson equation for the pressure field with Neumann boundary conditions in a geometry as complicated as that of the ocean basins. A major objective of the study is to make this inversion, and hence nonhydrostatic ocean modeling, efficient on parallel computers. The pressure field is separated into surface, hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic components. First, as in hydrostatic models, a two-dimensional problem is inverted for the surface pressure which is then made use of in the three-dimensional inversion for the nonhydrostatic pressure. Preconditioned conjugate-gradient iteration is used to invert symmetric elliptic operators in both two and three dimensions. Physically motivated preconditioners are designed which are efficient at reducing computation and minimizing communication between processors. Our method exploits the fact that as the horizontal scale of the motion becomes very much larger than the vertical scale, the motion becomes more and more hydrostatic and the three-dimensional Poisson operator becomes increasingly anisotropic and dominated by the vertical axis. Accordingly, a preconditioner is used which, in the hydrostatic limit, is an exact integral of the Poisson operator and so leads to a single algorithm that seamlessly moves from nonhydrostatic to hydrostatic limits. Thus in the hydrostatic limit the model is ''fast,'' competitive with the fastest ocean climate models in use today based on the hydrostatic primitive equations. But as the resolution is increased, the model dynamics asymptote smoothly to the Navier Stokes equations and so can be used to address small-scale processes. A ''finite-volume'' approach is employed to discretize the model in space in which property fluxes are defined normal to faces that delineate the volumes. The method makes possible a novel treatment of the boundary in which cells abutting the bottom or coast may take on irregular shapes and be ''shaved'' to fit the boundary. The algorithm can conveniently exploit massively parallel computers and suggests a domain decomposition which allocates vertical columns of ocean to each processing unit. The resulting model, which can handle arbitrarily complex geometry, is efficient and scalable and has been mapped on to massively parallel multiprocessors such as the Connection Machine (CM5) using data-parallel FORTRAN and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology data-flow machine MONSOON using the implicitly parallel language Id.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marshall, J</author><author>Hill, C</author><author>Perelman, L</author><author>Adcroft, Alistair J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrostatic, quasi-hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic ocean modeling</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans</full-title></periodical><pages>5733-5752</pages><volume>102</volume><issue>C3</issue><keywords><keyword>equations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/96jc02776</electronic-resource-num><notes>Marshall, J., C.

The quasi-hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic sets are more accurate than the widely used hydrostatic primitive equations. Quasi-hydrostatic models relax the precise balance between gravity and pressure gradient forces by including in a consistent manner cosine-of-latitude Coriolis terms which are neglected in primitive equation models. Nonhydrostatic models employ the full incompressible Navier Stokes equations; they are required in the study pf small-scale phenomena in the ocean which are not in hydrostatic balance. We outline a solution strategy for the Navier Stokes model on the sphere that performs efficiently across the whole range of scales in the ocean, from the convective scale to the global scale, and so leads to a model of great versatility. In;he hydrostatic limit the Navier Stokes' model involves no more computational effort than those models which assume strict hydrostatic balance on all scales. The strategy is illustrated in simulations of laboratory experiments in rotating convection on scales of a few centimeters, simulations of convective and baroclinic instability of the mixed layer on the 1- to 10-km scale, and simulations of the global circulation of the ocean.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fieguth, Paul W</author><author>Willsky, Alan S</author><author>Menemenlis, Dimitris</author><author>Wunsch, Carl I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A general multiresolution approach to the estimation of dense fields in remote sensing</title><secondary-title>ICIP'96 1996 IEEE Int.
