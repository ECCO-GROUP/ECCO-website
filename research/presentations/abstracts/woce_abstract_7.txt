Estimates of Secular Changes in the ECCO Global WOCE Synthesis

D. Stammer, B. Cornuelle and A. Koehl for the ECCO Consortium.

The ECCO global 1 degree WOCE Synthesis is analyzed with
respect to large-scale changes on interannual and longer time 
scales.  Emphasis is being put on deep temperature and salinity 
changes and their relations to variations in sea surface height.  
Changes in heat content on basin and global scale are compared to 
imbalances in net surface heat forcing and the problem of distinguishing
numerical model drift from long-term changes in the ocean is being 
discussed.
