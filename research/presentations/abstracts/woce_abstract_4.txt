The ECCO 1 degree global WOCE Synthesis: Estimated Ocean Variability

B. Cornuelle, A. Koehl, D. Stammer and C. Wunsch for the ECCO Consortium.

The global ECCO ocean state estimate is compared directly to observations 
from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment's (WOCE) one-time CTD sections. 
The goal is to determine the goodness of fit and examine the degree to 
which individual sections are representative of means.   Sections from 
the WOCE repeated high-resolution expendable bathythermograph (HRXBT) 
network in the Pacific are used to compare means, seasonal cycles, and 
interannual variability with that in the model.  HRXBT sections with at 
least 7 years of data are used to estimate the seasonal march of temperature, 
heat content, and steric height for comparison with the model.
