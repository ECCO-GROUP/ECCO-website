The ECCO 1 degree global WOCE Synthesis: Estimates of Surface Fluxes

D. Stammer, K. Uejoshi, W. Large and C. Wunsch for the ECCO Consortium.

Surface fluxes of stress, heat and moisture are included in the control
vectors of the ECCO global ocean state estimate. As such, the prior
values (from NCEP)  are adjusted, along with other control variables,
to bring the model into better agreement with the WOCE observations.

Here we test the adjusted estimates against independent ones derived
from bulk formula and satellite observations. All ECCO adjustments
are within the crude prior error bars prescribed for these fields.
On the large scale, adjustments  are therefore consistent with known 
deficiencies in the NCEP products.  On the large scales, the inferred 
adjustments to NCEP winds are consistent also with values obtained from 
satellite wind measurements.  However, on regional scale wind adjustments
exhibit features that reflect ocean model inability to resolve intense 
boundary currents. Further improvements in the surface flux estimates 
obtained using data assimilation are anticipated as the estimation 
procedure becomes more complete, and the ocean model more accurate.
