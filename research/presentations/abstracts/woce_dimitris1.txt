Calibrating the ECCO Ocean General Circulation
Model Using WOCE Data and Model Green's Functions

Dimitris Menemenlis, Ichiro Fukumori, Tong Lee, and Lee-Lueng Fu

Model Green's functions provide a simple, yet effective, method to test and
calibrate General-Circulation-Model (GCM) parameterizations, to study and
quantify model and data errors, to correct model biases and trends, and to
blend estimates from different solutions and data products.  These properties
are demonstrated within the context of the ECCO (Estimating the Circulation
and Climate of the Ocean, http://www.ecco-group.org) ocean data assimilation
project using a subset of WOCE data.
