ECCO Estimates of Large-scale Changes at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series Station

D. Stammer, S. Park, A. Koehl, R. Lukas, and F. Santiago-Mandujano 

A comparison of ECCO ocean estimates is being provided
with independent observations at the HOT deep-water station.
The goal is to compare and identify similar inter-annual changes in
the HOT observations and use the ECCO estimates to infer their
origin.  Based on the ECCO WOCE synthesis, a complete balance of
temperature and salinity  (freshwater) anomalies will be provided
at the HOT station to help interpret the local time series
measurements as a function of depth. In addition we will use the 
adjoint framework to identify the area (in space and time) that 
can in principle be influenced by the HOT measurements in a 
dynamically consistent assimilation framework.
