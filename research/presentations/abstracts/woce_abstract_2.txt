Errors.

The ECCO global ocean state estimate over the 10-year period 1992 - 2001 
is obtained by fitting WOCE data sets to a general circulation model. Data 
included are most of the in situ and satellite observations available during 
WOCE itself, and continuing. These data include satellite altimetry, scatterometry 
and SST fields, in situ hydrographic sections, XBT, P-ALACE, ARGO and TAO 
profiles, surface drifter velocities and Levitus climatological hydrography. 
As with all statistical estimation problems, one must provide a priori
error covariances for all data sets, and the values and structures used in
the estimation procedures are described here.
