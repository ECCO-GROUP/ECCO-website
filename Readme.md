## ECCO Website

### Guidelines for editing 
1. Always insert your name and date as a comment to any item added.
   e.g., ```<!-- Ian Fenty 2018-11-06 -->```
1. Images on the landing page carousel expand to fill the whole page by default.  I don't know how to change that behavior.  To avoid giant plots you can embed your image within a larger black image.  Here is an [example](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-website/blob/master/assets/images/home/Pie17carousel.jpg).  I also made a ```svg``` template that you can use [here](https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-website/blob/master/assets/images/home/fenty_front_page_image_template.svg)
